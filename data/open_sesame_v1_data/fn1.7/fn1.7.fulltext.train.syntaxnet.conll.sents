Taiwan Overview :
Note : Taiwan is claimed by both the Government of the People's Republic of China and the authorities on Taiwan .
It is administered by the authorities on Taiwan .
Taiwan does not possess nuclear weapons , but began a covert nuclear weapons program in 1964 that ended in 1988 as a result of U.S. pressure .
Taiwan signed the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) in 1968 and has implemented the International Atomic Energy Agency 's ( IAEA ) `` Program 93+2 '' safeguards .
Despite persistent suspicions of offensive and defensive chemical and biological weapons ( CBW ) programs , there is no conclusive evidence that Taiwan has developed or deployed chemical or biological weapons .
Taiwan is currently developing the Tien Chi , a short-range ballistic missile system that can reach the coast of China .
Nuclear:
Taiwan 's first nuclear reactor was built at National Tsinghua University in 1956 , and its first nuclear power plant was opened in 1965 .
Taiwan now possesses six nuclear units housed in three nuclear power plants with a total capacity of 5,144 megawatts .
Although plagued by domestic opposition and delays , a fourth nuclear power plant is scheduled to begin operation in 2006 .
Taiwan 's nuclear weapons program was established under the direction of the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research ( INER ) and the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology following the People's Republic of China 's first nuclear test in October 1964 .
The `` Hsin Chu `` program involved procurement and operation of a heavy water reactor , a heavy water production plant , a reprocessing research laboratory , and a plutonium separation plant .
U.S. pressure caused Taiwan to end its nuclear weapons program in 1988 after International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) inspections discovered missing fuel rods and the former deputy director of INER defected to the United States with detailed information about Taiwan 's program .
Taiwan probably possesses the technological expertise necessary to develop nuclear weapons , but U.S. pressure and the possibility of a pre-emptive strike by China have prevented a resumption of the nuclear weapons program .
Biological:
Taiwan has been accused of making efforts to acquire a biological weapons ( BW ) capability .
A report from the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service claimed that Taiwan has developed three dozen types of bacteria , apparently for weaponization purposes .
This report , of questionable reliability , was vigorously denied by the Ministry of National Defense ( MND ) .
Taiwan signed the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention ( BWC ) in 1972 , but its role in this treaty is not officially recognized .
Taiwan has not been permitted to join the Australia Group .
Chemical :
In 1989 , the U.S. Congress was informed that Taiwan could have acquired an offensive chemical weapons ( CW ) capability .
While acknowledging production of small quantities of CW agents for defense research purposes , Taiwanese authorities have consistently denied any offensive CW capabilities .
Still , rumors persist that Taiwan has stockpiled sarin in two locations : Tsishan ( Kaohsiung ) and in Kuanhsi , Hsinchu County .
Chemical defense research and development is conducted at the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology .
Because of Taiwan 's non - state status , it can not join the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) nor the Australia Group .
Missile:
Taiwan 's short - range ballistic missile ( SRBM ) program is based at the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology , which has developed a range of missiles including the Hsiung Feng series of anti-ship missiles , the Tien Chien series of air - to - air missiles , and the Tien Kung series of surface - to - air missiles .
These systems have provided Taiwanese scientists with experience and a technological base in areas such as composite materials and guidance and fire control systems , which are essential for development of longer range surface -to - surface missiles .
Taiwan has two SRBM programs .
The liquid - fueled , single - stage Ching Feng has a range of 130 km with a 270 kg payload .
Initially deployed in the early 1980s , it is unclear how many Ching Feng missiles were built and whether they are still operational .
The Tien Chi , first test - fired in 1997 , is a solid - fueled , two - stage missile with a 300 km range that can reach China 's southeastern coast .
The Tien Chi incorporates global positioning system technology and has an estimated payload of 100 - 500 kg. One report claims that as many as 50 Tien Chi missiles have been deployed on Tungyin Island and at an unidentified second location .
Development of the Tien Ma , a ballistic missile with a range of 950 km , was reportedly discontinued in the early 1980s due to U.S. pressure .
U.S. Congressman Arrives in Iraq for Landmark Visit BAGHDAD , April 16 ( Xinhua ) --
U.S. Congressman Tony Hall arrived here Sunday evening , becoming the first U.S. lawmaker to visit Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War .
Hall , heading a three-member delegation , arrived here at 19:17 ( 1517 GMT ) by land from Jordanian capital Amman , and stayed at the five-star Mansour Hotel .
At the entrance of the Mansour Hotel , Hall made a brief statement , saying that he came to Iraq because he has heard for a long time about the humanitarian situation here , especially the malnutrition among the Iraqi children and the increasing mortality rate of the children and the elderly .
He also said that his visit will mainly focus on the humanitarian situation of Iraq , which has been under crippling U.N. sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait , the primacord of the 1991 Gulf War .
`` The visit is not a political visit , it is a visit of humanitarian concerns , '' he added .
`` There are a lot of issues I want to take a look at , but the issue of humanitarian concerns is number one , '' he said .
During his stay in Iraq , he will visit several places , including hospitals and schools , in Baghdad and southern Iraq , where the U.S. and Britain imposed a no - fly zone , with the claimed aim of protecting Shi 'ite Muslims from possible attacks by Iraqi government .
Bombing targets in the no - fly zones in southern and northern Iraq by U.S. and British warplanes have almost become a daily occurrence , causing serious civilian casualties .
When asked by Xinhua if there is any plan for him to meet Iraq officials , he said `` I have not been asked to meet any top Iraqi officials .
My concern is with the Red Cross , the ( Iraqi) Red Crescent , to see what they have to show me , to see with my own eyes and make up my own mind . ''
However , it has been reported that Hall is expected to meet Iraqi Health Minister Umid Medhat Mubarak and representatives of all international aid organizations working in Iraq .
Iraq has claimed that more than 1.5 million people , mostly children and the elderly , have died of curable diseases due to the decade-long U.N. sanctions .
Iraq has accused the U.S. , which vehemently opposes the lifting of the sanctions against Iraq , of using the sanctions as a tool to contain the Iraqi regime headed by President Saddam Hussein .
Earlier this year , some 70 U.S. congressmen sent a letter to U. S. President Bill Clinton , calling for an end to the humanitarian crisis in Iraq by having the sanctions lifted .
We do n't know who is winning the drug war in Latin America , but we know who 's losing it -- the press .
Over the past six months , six journalists have been killed and 10 kidnapped by drug traffickers or leftist guerrillas -- who often are one and the same -- in Colombia .
Over the past 12 years , at least 40 journalists have died there .
The attacks have intensified since the Colombian government began cracking down on the traffickers in August , trying to prevent their takeover of the country .
The slaughter in Colombia was very much on the minds of 450 editors and publishers from Latin America , the United States , the Caribbean and Canada attending the 45th general assembly of the Inter-American Press Association in Monterrey , Mexico , this week .
On Tuesday the conference got word of another atrocity , the assassination in Medellin of two employees of El Espectador , Colombia 's second-largest newspaper .
The paper 's local administrator , Maria Luz Lopez , was shot dead , and her mother wounded , while her car was stopped for a red light .
An hour later , the paper 's circulation manager , Miguel Soler , was shot and killed near his home .
The drug lords who claimed responsibility said they would blow up the Bogota newspaper 's offices if it continued to distribute in Medellin .
They bombed the Bogota offices last month , destroying its computer and causing $2.5 million in damage .
El Espectador has been a special target because of the extraordinary courage of its publisher and his staff .
At Monterrey , publisher Luis Gabriel Cano , although shaken by the murders , issued a statement saying : `` We will not cease our fight against drug trafficking .
They want to terrify the press and in particular El Espectador because it has always been a torchbearer in this war . ''
This comes from a man whose brother , Guillermo , was murdered in 1986 .
The publishers in Monterrey command no battalions , but they agreed to express their outrage with editorials in today 's editions .
Many will use a common editorial .
A final statement yesterday said : `` While some advances are being made in nations throughout the hemisphere , the state of press freedom in the Americas still must be regarded as grim as long as journalists and their families are subject to the crudest form of censorship : death by assassination . ''
The report charged that Panama 's Manuel Noriega is not only in league with the drug traffickers but also is bullying the press as never before .
`` Noriega has closed every independent newspaper , radio and television station and arrested , tortured or forced into exile a long list of reporters , '' the statement declared .
It added : `` In Cuba , public enemy No. 1 of press freedoms in the hemisphere , repression of journalists both Cuban and foreign is worse than ever . ''
And in Nicaragua , promises of press freedom by the Sandinistas `` have not materialized . ''
As it happens , the four countries cited , Colombia , Cuba , Panama and Nicaragua , are not only where the press is under greatest attack but also are linked by the drug trade and left-wing politics .
Noriega is close to Castro and may once have been his agent .
Sandinistas Thomas Borge and the Ortega brothers are Castro proteges ; he backed their takeover of Nicaragua .
In Colombia , the drug-financed guerrillas trying to seize the country and destroy democracy include M-19 , which Castro has clearly backed .
Robert Merkel , a former U.S. attorney handling drug indictments in Florida , does n't think for a minute that Castro 's much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the Medellin drug cartel .
`` If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the Colombian authorities into negotiations , the cartel will be in control and Fidel can exploit his past relationships with them , '' he told the Journal 's David Asman recently .
The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing .
This week , the government arrested Jose Abello Silva , said to be the fourth-ranking cartel leader .
He will probably be extradited to the U.S. for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived .
Later , another high-ranking trafficker , Leonidas Vargas , was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized .
Mr . Barco has refused U.S. troops or advisers but has accepted U.S. military aid .
President Bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with Mr . Barco , President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem .
It might not be a bad idea to do that sooner , rather than later .
After the Panama fiasco , they will need some reassurance .
Certainly , the Colombian press is much in need of that .
Thoughts about Security of Principal Squads
Praise Allah who said provide those who believed with security and peace be upon our prophet .
The enemy confronting our society falls in three categories : 1- Hostile intelligence organizations , such as the United States , Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Pakistan and the Jews 2- The straying group who are atheists and apostates 3- The existing environment .
They include the deposed regime , the tribal cliques , the hired fighters , and the standard criminals .
The above groups pose the following dangers : 1- Attacking for the purpose of : A : Assassination B : Kidnapping C : Aerial raids and artillery attacks 2- Sabotage A : Setting fires B : Explosions C : Technical sabotage D : Chemical sabotage 3- Spying A : Recruiting a member of society B : Planting a mole within society C : Spying surveillance operation 4- Stealing 5- Pests : A : Poisonous such as snakes and scorpions B : Harmful such as rats and cockroaches C : Sickening such as mosquitoes
In order to face these dangers , we resort to a plan which includes the external factors , the internal factors and spying .
External : All actions and methods adopted to confront dangers from outside .
Internal : All actions and methods adopted to confront dangers from within .
Spying : Confronting infiltration operations carried out by spying agents or moles .
Chapter One
External Security
First : Choosing the Location
1- Choosing mountainous locations , preferably 1-3 hours from main cities , which have water resources .
2- Being close to cities is important in order to have important services .
3- If a mountainous location is unviable , then choose a location next to official buidings so as to avoid being bombarded .
4- Again , if the above is not possible , then choose a location next to residential areas , for the same reason as above .
5- The location should be away from airports and main highways .
It is preferable it has its own private access in order to protect it and control it better .
Second : Protection Methods
1- Outside Protection : A : Barriers , walls , parking lots B : Human protection : - Patrols close to locations - Patrols distant from the location C : Animal protection : Dogs D : Electronic protection : Cameras , alarm equipment , night vision equipment ... etc
Permanent Protection :
*Barriers
They are erected according to the nature of the location .
They can take one of the following forms : 1- Steel pipes : Insert 4 inch pipes in the ground at 50 centimeters apart and a height of one meter then fill them with cement 2- Barrels : They are filled with cement and place around the building , especially at the entrance to prevent cars from crashing into it 3- Ditches : They are better than road bumps because they are harder to see .
The ditch should be 30 centimeters deep and 20 centimeters wide .
Passageways for cars and pedestrians should be designated 4- Road bumps : Six successive bumps should be constructed at 500 meters from the location .
The distance between the first and fourth bump should be 100 meters , and the distance between the fourth and the sixth should be 50 meters , so cars can not travel fast in the direction of the building 5- Barbed Wires : They should be placed around the building , around the walls , or on top of the walls 6- Nails Obstacle : These are placed at the main gate in order to puncture the tires of any car crashing in
*Fences
Fences are the best form of permanent protection .
It shields off all activities which take place inside the location .
The following should be considered when erecting fences:
1- The fence which is built out of bricks or concrete should be 4 meters high , then topped with one meter high barbed wire fence .
It is preferable that the barbed wires slant outwards at a 70 degrees angle .
2- The thickness of the fence should be 60 cm and the distance between it and the building should be 2 meters .
3- Secret gates should be built 50 meters apart to be used for emergency only .
However , they should not be identifiable from the outside part of the fence .
4- It is preferable that any location has only 2 emergency gates and far away from one another .
5- No other outside gates should be erected .
If it is necessary to have an outside entrance for the control tower , then access to the location should not be constructed .
6- If the location is in a highly dangerous zone , then two parallel fences should be built to be 3 meters apart .
The space between the two fences could be mined in order to prevent infiltration .
7- It is preferable the fence be square or rectangular in shape .
A circular shaped fence is harder to protect because of hidden angles .
Parking:
Parking areas are of importance because most sabotage operations are done with cars .
Therefore , it is important to adopt following : 1- The parking lot should be 50 meters away from the fence .
If the nature of the terrain does not allow it , then it should be on the other side of the road .
2- Under no circumstance a car , even that which belongs to the location should be permitted to park next to the fence .
3- Assign a parking spot for visitors which would not make them feel insulted .
Usually such parking spots are on the side of the lot .
4- Inside parking lot should be strictly designated to the location 's cars in order to protect them from sabotage .
Also , the visitors with high security clearance should be designated parking spots inside the location .
5- Cars parked inside the location should have their front facing the fence so they could be used quickly in case of emergency .
6- All parking regulations of the location should be followed strictly followed .
Human protection
Buses
Some buses should be exposed and others should be camouflaged .
A : Exposed Busses : One at the tip of the road .
One in front of the location .
One at the back of the location .
The buses should have the following : 1- Light armor and rocket launchers 2- Wireless equipment to report dangerous activities 3- Writing materials to jot down suspicious activities or license plate numbers 4- Sand bags around the buses to protect them from gun fire
B : Camouflaged Buses .
These are camouflaged to look like commercial companies ' vehicles or traveling salesmen 's vehicles .
They are entrusted with the task of tracking down the movement of strangers who are approaching the location .
Kiosks:
The objective of having kiosks is they serve as communication points between the guards and the visitors or those who are approaching the building and deal with them according to their requirements .
The following should be observed:
1- Kiosks should be placed at entrance gates to check visitors when approaching the building .
2- Kiosks should be placed at key important locations where 24-hour security watch is required .
3- The Kiosk should be designed to stand all weather conditions , and provide a full coverage of the area it is placed at .
4- The Kiosk should be equipped with wireless communication equipment , and a mechanist to open and close the gate automatically .
5- Direct the visitors ' cars to special parking spots , away from the fence and the control tower .
Towers :
The following should be observed:
1- The lower part of the tower should serve as a shelter for the guards , when needed .
Going up the tower should be from inside .
2- The towers should be located in a manner where they can easily communicate with one another , and totally cover the area they are guarding .
They should have telescopes in order to constantly control the areas around them .
3- Entrances to the towers should be totally camouflaged .
4- They should have a protruding area to better control their surroundings .
Outside Patrols
The locality can not be fully protected without having patrols roaming on the outside area of the fence .
The above mentioned protection procedures are only for observation purposes , while patrols check the fences , the barriers , and the towers , and submit periodic reports on their findings .
It also checks on guard posts .
They also engage with persons approaching the locality and support the guards in their duties .
They also provide extra fire power in when guards or other patrols are engaged in a gun battle .
These patrols are formed as follows : 1- Single patrols which consist of two people checking the outside area of the location 2- Common patrols which consist of one man and a dog , also checking the outside area of the location .
These patrols tour the area during specific times such as , dinner , dawn, dusk , and midnight
The patrol should be armed with light weapon such as Kalashnikovs and RPGs , and cover the area on foot .
Area Patrols
These patrols comb the greater area surrounding the location periodically ; anywhere between 3 and four times a week The patrol should be lead by a security officer in order to take immediate actions if the need arises .
Also , the duty of area patrols is to discover new paths and shelters in the area in order to hide fighters after a Jihad operation against the enemy .
The area patrol is different from the single patrol in that : 1- It has a vehicle equipped with a machine gun 2- It can use horses to canvass the area , but the patrol should be formed of 2 or 3 people at least
Chapter Two
Internal Protection
This kind of protection should be done without drawing attention so that people inside the location would feel at ease .
The location should have a fence with towers that is equipped with visual and aural equipment .
First : Guarding
Patrols .
Night Password .
Body guards .
Second : Regulations for Visitors and their Belongings
1- Individuals A : Trustworthy - Arabs and foreigners B : Untrustworthy - Arabs and foreigners C : Unknown - Arabs and foreigners D : Reporters and news people
2- Belongings A : Cars B : Personal effects C : Electronic equipment .
A strict control system should cover the above items .
Third : Defense Plan - Firefighting
Administration Staff Responsibilities : 1- Buy equipment and machinery soonest 2- Install the yanks and the faucets
Firefighters Responsibilities : 1- Firefighting training 2- Evacuation training 3- Supervise the fire equipment in order to ensure : A : It remains in place B : Does not get damaged 4- Run some tests to identify the negatives .
The security team should : A : Publish a periodic bulletin and distribute to all residents , advising them how to safely store gaz and logs B : Keep the firefighters alert at all times C : Report any thing that might be a fire hazard D : Warn against the safety of children 's toys E : Urge everyone to take precautions and guard their homes tightly
Fourth : Defending the Location Plan .

Sixth : Supply mechanical and electronic equipment .
Seventh : Provide labor force .
Eighth : Provide security to top dignitaries .
Ninth : Control pests .
Chapter Three
Counter Terrorism
Spying : 1- Recruiting 2- Placing Spies A : Arabs B : Foreigners 3- Kidnapping
Forest fires burn on in Greece ; death toll nears 50
In southern Greece today , huge forest fires continue to burn on destroying homes and causing severe damage to the region .
Local fire departments put the current death toll at at least 37 , nine of which were children .
Since Friday morning , around 170 fires have been burning , many of which are believed to be caused by arson .
Authorities are calling the fires `` criminal acts . ''
Fire department spokesman Nikos Diamandis said most of the fires were started in entirely different areas , and were started after dark .
Some fires reportedly broke out in `` lush greenery . ''
27 deaths have been confirmed in Peloponnese , one of the hardest hit areas .
Today , however , fires broke out near Athens .
Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis was to for an emergency meeting of the senior ministers in the country 's capital , Athens .
Karamanlis said , `` This is a day of national mourning ... I wish to express my deep grief over the lost lives ... We are fighting against heavy odds , on many fronts and under particularly tough conditions . ''
Greece 's government yesterday asked its European Union allies for help .
About 30 countries are offering support , according to an EU statement .
New fires were reportedly still breaking out this morning .
Some helicopters and airplanes , which were to drop water on the fires , continued to be delayed by strong winds .
IRAQ-POVERTY ( Washington )
Rep . Tony Hall , D- Ohio , urges the United Nations to allow a freer flow of food and medicine into Iraq .
Hall , who recently returned from a trip to Iraq , said U.N. economic sanctions have hurt millions of civilians there .

Blue Mountains fires burn out of control
Two large fires in the New South Wales Blue Mountains , West of Sydney are burning out of control in difficult fire fighting conditions .
The first , a 8,000 hectare blaze near Blackheath , which has been burning for nine days broke containment lines at 11 PM AEDT on Monday .
Fire crews had been attempting to contain the fire before the onset of difficult conditions today .
Commissioner of the NSW Rural Fire Service said fire fighters had made a brave effort to contain the fire .
When the fire jumped containment lines , around 95 percent of the fire had been contained .
'' They 've worked extremely hard now for six days but probably their most herculean effort was last night , '' My Koperberg said .
'' They were down on the Grose River working in atrocious conditions as a last-ditch stand ... and they nearly got there .
'' They had several metres still to go when it became too hot and we had to evacuate them because it would have endangered them . ''
A second fire has begun burning on a 5 km ( 3 mile ) front , along the Putty Road near Wiseman 's Ferry .
It is thought that the fire could affect the village of St Albans .
With temperatures in the high 30 degree Celsius range and winds around 50 km/h ( 31 Mph ) , fire fighters are bracing for the worst in the Blue Mountains over the next few days .
It is feared forecasted wind gusts of up to 80 km/h ( 49 Mph ) overnight could fan the first fire into the township of Winmalee as it heads East .
Dublin and the Dubliners
As capital of Europe 's most explosive economy , Dublin seems to be changing before your very eyes .
New construction is everywhere , the streets buzz , traffic is increasingly congested , and in the frenetic pace of rush hour everyone in Dublin seems intent on changing places with everyone else .
At night the streets are crowded with people bent on having a good time .
Prosperity is in the air ; the roar of the `` Celtic Tiger `` can clearly be heard .
But this is not the whole picture .
The proverbial hospitality and warm welcome are still here .
This busy , modern European city sits on a thousand years of history -- history is present everywhere , from elegant Merrion Square to the bullet holes on the General Post Office .
It 's also a city of the imagination , reinvented and reappraised in the literature of its exiles .
And the old Dublin is with us , too -- the irreverent city of wit and charm and that peculiar magic possessed by Ireland and the Irish .
Prosperity has brought with it a new emphasis on historic preservation .
Dublin excels in packaging its past for the visitor .
You can view artifacts from the Bronze Age , trace the history of the Easter Rising , or revisit Leopold Bloom 's odyssey in Ulysses .
Old buildings are being recycled ; for example , the 17th-century Royal Hospital now holds the Museum of Modern Art .
And Dublin , a city large in expectations , is still small enough for the visitor to see most of its sights on foot .
City on the Liffey
The River Liffey flows from west to east through the center of the city to Dublin Bay .
The river forms a natural line between the north and south sections of the city .
This geography is important in understanding Dublin .
Historically and culturally this north-south distinction has always been significant , and it still is today , with a dose of good-humored rivalry between the two areas .
``
I never go north of the Liffey , '' one man remarked .
Farther out , both north and south , are the sweeping curves of the Royal and Grand Canals .
The occasional cry of gulls and unexpected distant vistas will remind you that Dublin is by the sea , and the Wicklow mountains , which hold Dublin closely to the coast , are visible from everywhere .
Dublin is an intimate city , physically small but tightly packed , a perfect place for walking .
College Green , the home of Trinity College , provides a natural focus just south of the O'Connell Street bridge .
O'Connell Street , the city 's grand boulevard , leads north to Parnell Square .
To the south and east is St . Stephen 's Green and Georgian Dublin where the national museums are located .
Along the Liffey to the west is Temple Bar , center of nightlife and home to many of Dublin 's cutting-edge artists and artistic endeavors .
Up the hill from Temple Bar are Dublin Castle and Christ Church Cathedral .
It wo n't rain on you in Dublin all the time .
The climate here can best be described as `` changeable '' and yet the sudden shifts from light to dark , sunshine to shower , are part of the city 's magic .
Buildings seem to transform themselves depending on the light ; Dublin under a lowering sky is a different place from Dublin in sunshine .
Enjoying Dublin
Literature has always flourished in Dublin , the only city to have produced three Nobel Prize winners for literature -- Yeats , Shaw , and Beckett .
Joyce , the high priest of literary Modernism , imagined and interpreted Dublin for the world in Ulysses ( you 'll see references to it all over ) .
However , sometimes it seems that the city produced artists of this stature by accident , even against its will .
Beckett and Joyce , among others , had to leave their homeland to understand it -- and to be understood .
Dublin theater is legendary , and no visitor should miss seeing a performance at the Abbey Theatre or Gate Theatre .
The city 's impact on the rock and pop music scene with the likes of U2 and Bob Geldof is well known -- there 's even a self-guided tour of their haunts .
Traditional Irish music is also alive and well , especially in the pubs , and there has been a revival of storytelling , poetry reading , and traditional dancing .
And in this city , where literature and theater have historically dominated the scene , visual arts are finally coming into their own with the new Museum of Modern Art and the many galleries that display the work of modern Irish artists .
The constantly crowded and busy Grafton street is the most visible center for shopping , but there are shops all over that carry an international array of goods as well as the Irish crafts and souvenirs you expect .
And while multinational chains have made inroads , they seem less blatant here than elsewhere .
Many shops , and also hotels and guest houses , have been owned and managed by the same families for years , and theirs is the welcome of traditional Dublin hospitality .
Dublin 's food has undergone a metamorphosis .
There was a time when you might have apologized for it , but no longer .
Dublin has international restaurants galore , and the New Irish Cuisine is built upon fresh products of Ireland 's seas , rivers , and farms .
Coffee has replaced the ubiquitous tea -- Dublin is now almost as much a coffee city as Vienna or Seattle .
City and Countryside
In a city of such human proportions it is not surprising that parks and gardens abound for recreation and relaxation .
Phoenix Park in the northwest is the largest open space , but squares like St . Stephen 's Green are the garden oases of the city .
On the coast , Sandymount , Dollymount , and Killiney strands are the places to go .
The beautiful Wicklow Mountains , and the Wicklow Mountains National Park provide a more rugged countryside , and the area has breathtaking houses and gardens such as Castletown , Mount Usher , and Powerscourt .
To the north and west are the ancient sites of Ireland : Malahide Castle , the evocative hill of Tara , and the long barrows of Knowth and Newgrange .
The DART ( Dublin Area Rapid Transit ) runs north and south along the coast .
It 's an ideal way for the visitor to reach outlying sights and villages .
There are many guided bus tours to sights outside the city , and some are accessible by city bus .
Young at Heart ?
Dublin is a young city .
Almost half of Ireland 's population is under twenty-five , and with its universities and professional schools , Dublin also has a large student population .
The universities attract students from all over the world , and this influx helps to make Dublin a busy , buzzing international city .
However , young and old , stranger and Dubliner rub shoulders quite happily .
Religion and respect for parents has not yet gone out of fashion .
And young graduates are not leaving now -- multinational corporations and European Union investment mean there are plenty of opportunities for them at home .
Unemployment is at an all-time low .
The Irish are actually beginning to come home .
A 12-year-old boy reports seeing a man launch a rubber boat from a car parked at the harbor . 
FBI officials find what they believe may be explosives in the car . 
Yemeni police trace the car to a nearby house . 
The FBI finds traces of explosives on clothes found ; neighbors say they saw two men who they describe as `` Arab-looking '' living there for several weeks . 
Police also find a second house where authorities believe two others may have assembled the bomb , possibly doing some welding . 
Passports found in one of the houses identify the men as from a privilege convenience province noted for lawless tribes . 
But the documents turn out to be fakes . 
Meantime, analysts at the FBI crime lab try to discover what the bomb was made from . 
No conclusions yet , U.S. officials say , but a working theory , plastic explosive . 
But Yemen 's president says the FBI has told him the explosive material could only have come from the U.S. , Israel or two Arab countries . 
And to a former federal bomb investigator , that description suggests a powerful military-style plastic explosive C-4 that can be cut or molded into different shapes . 
Overview
Iran is often accused in Western circles of secretly developing an offensive biological warfare ( BW ) program .
In a 1996 report to the US Senate , the Central Intelligence Agency claimed that `` Iran has had a biological warfare program since the early 1980s .
Currently the program is in its research and development stages , but we believe Iran holds some stocks of BW agents and weapons ... ''
Iran has ratified the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention ( BWC ) and publicly decried all forms of weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) .
At the same time , it does have a very sophisticated biotechnology infrastructure that includes leading research facilities and trained personnel .
It has also participated in several scientific exchanges with foreign experts .
Iran has shown an interest in acquiring BW agents from foreign sources .
The speaker of the Iranian parliament publicly stated in 1988 that `` ... we should fully equip ourselves in defensive and offensive use of chemical , bacteriological , and radiological weapons . ''
Canadian and Dutch scientists were approached by Iranian personnel looking to acquire mycotoxin - producing fungi ( Fusarium spp. ) in 1989 .
Sources also claim that Iran has pursued the acquisition of castor beans ( known to be used for producing the deadly toxin ricin ) and retains several cultures of the anthrax - producing bacteria Bacillus anthracis .
Given Iran 's strong biotechnology and pharmaceutical infrastructure , it is not difficult to envision the development of a concealed BW program .
Several dual - use items have been imported into Iran from Western countries , and Iran is also working closely with India and Cuba within the realm of biotechnology .
History
Some Western sources believe that Iran first developed its BW program during the Iran - Iraq War ( 1980 - 88 ) .
Currently , its growing biotechnology industry does have the potential to divert dual - use agents for illicit warfare purposes .
There are several reasons why Iran would pursue a BW program , including establishing a deterrent against Iraq , establishing regional dominance , or developing an alternative to conventional weapons for asymmetric conflicts .
Some experts speculate that in its biological arsenal , Iran possess agents such as botulinum toxin , B. anthracis , and ricin .
In the early 1980s , upon approval of the World Federation of Culture Collections , the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Biotechnology set up a 600 - strain Persian Type Culture Collection to assist Iran 's biotechnology industry .
In August 1989 , Iran was accused of trying to purchase strains of Fusarium spp. from Canada and the Netherlands , which could be used to develop T-2 mycotoxin .
It is believed that the strains were destined for the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology and the Imam Reza Medical Center .
It must be noted that Dr . Bruno Schiefer , the Canadian toxicologist approached by Iran , was doubtful that Iran would use the strains for illicit BW purposes .
While the two strains of fusaria Iran requested are in fact dangerous to animal and human nervous systems , Schiefer contended that the toxins ( T-2 and related `` trichothecene mycotoxins '' ) produced by the fungi would not kill quickly enough to be an effective agent .
Contravening his own argument , however , Schiefer also speculated that the Iranians were most likely trying to acquire the fungi for defensive purposes , such as developing gas masks that would be protective in the event of its offensive use .
T-2 and other trichothecene mycotoxins are suspected components of `` yellow rain , '' which was allegedly used in battle by Communist regimes in Southeast Asia during the 1970s and early 1980s .
European firms have been targeted by Iranians for technology and equipment .
In addition , it has been alleged that former Soviet bioweaponeers have been hired by Iran to specifically work on its BW arsenal .
These scientists are supposedly experimenting with the causative agents of such diseases as Marburg , smallpox , plague , and tularemia .
According to Michael Eisenstadt , Iran `` probably is researching such standard agents as anthrax and botulin toxin and it has shown interest in acquiring materials which could be used to produce ricin and mycotoxins . ''
Another report indicates that `` Iran has ... conducted extensive research on more lethal active agents like anthrax , hoof and mouth disease , and biotoxins . ''
It must be noted that this latter source , cited by Anthony Cordesman , can not be independently corroborated , and firsthand data on Iranian BW agents is unavailable in open sources .
Agents and Delivery
Some of the most common agents that are associated with the Iranian BW program in the open literature are B. anthracis , botulinum toxin , ricin , T-2 mycotoxin , and Variola virus , the causative agent of smallpox .
A table of cultures that Iran is known to possess is available in the Biological Capabilities section .
With respect to delivery of any BW agent , it is not immediately clear what route Iran has taken or will take .
Some experts believe that Iran is developing the capability to deliver biological agents by Scud missiles , aircraft , or other aerosolization techniques .
According to the CIA , Iran possesses weaponized biological agents that could be dispersed by artillery and aerial bombs .
The Iranian Shahab missile is reportedly capable of carrying biological warheads .
Iran has also conducted chemical and biological defense military exercises with helicopter sprayers and worked with cruise and ballistic missiles , although there is no concrete evidence that it has developed a biological warhead to be fit on such missiles .
Status
Iran does have technological sophistication in the biopharmaceutical industries and produces a variety of vaccines for humans and livestock .
The Razi Institute for Serums and Vaccines and the Pasteur Institute are leading regional facilities in the development and manufacture of vaccines .
In January 1997 , Iran created an organization called the Iranian Biotechnology Society ( IBS ) , which serves as an umbrella organization to bring together various institutes and individuals focusing on biotechnology related research .
IBS has several branches and over 350 members .
As there is no concrete mechanism for verifying government reports or allegations from exile groups , many of the allegations regarding the Iranian BW program remain unsubstantiated .
Most of the literature and accusations come from CIA reports , uncited writings of experts , and claims made by Iranian dissidents .
The majority of these reports cite Iranian attempts to purchase fusaria from Canada and the Netherlands as evidence that Iran is working on a covert weapons program .
While this could be true , it should be noted that the utility of these fungal species is not limited to BW applications .
For instance , the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology claims it researches Fusarium spp. to fight agricultural ailments in sunflower , tomato , and tobacco fields .
Also , Iran offered one of its premier facilities , the Razi Institute for Serums and Vaccines , to host mock inspections for the BWC .
If covert activities had in fact been taking place at this location , these inspections would have significantly jeopardized such efforts .
Research of publicly released information from Iranian scientific institutions shows no concrete proof of an offensive BW program .
However , the available information does not disprove allegations made by a variety of sources .
The sophisticated research facilities in Iran could easily serve as a front for illicit BW - related activities and offer a legitimate excuse to import dual - use material .
Before the 1990 Gulf War , Iraq had used its single cell protein research program at al-Hakam to camouflage its development of biological agents , including B. anthracis .
Similar , presumably legitimate advanced research is being carried out at the National Research Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology near Tehran .
Even if Iran possesses these biological agents , it faces a significant challenge in their weaponization and delivery .
There is no indication that Iran has successfully weaponized BW agents .
Given its current state of technology and the problems associated with delivering a sophisticated BW agent , it is unlikely that Iran currently has the means to carry out a significant biological attack .
Capabilities
Overview
Iran has one of the most advanced biotech industries in the developing world , and has long been recognized as a leader in Southwest Asia in the fields of vaccine research and production .
Agricultural Biotechnology :
One of Iran 's primary biotech focuses is research on agricultural science .
In this field , Iran 's research is concentrated in creating genes that produce toxins against insect pests ; improving the biological resistance of plants ; formulating new pesticides ; improving techniques of spraying or otherwise disseminating pesticides ; investigating the effects on native plant species after they have been introduced to various pests and diseases ; preventing the production of mycotoxins in crops ; producing plant viruses and their corresponding antiserums for an antiserum bank ; and manufacturing pheromones and hormones to combat arthropods that harm Iran 's agricultural industry .
All of these research areas have legitimate and important uses for improving crop yields and reducing the threat to Iran 's agricultural industry posed by pests and disease .
However , the expertise , equipment , and methodologies involved are intrinsically dual - use , and thus could conceivably be applied for illicit purposes if so desired .
Genetic Engineering and Vaccine Production :
Iran maintains three important facilities for research on combating the spread of disease .
Two of these facilities , the Pasteur Institute and the National Research Center of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology ( NRCGEB ) , focus primarily on diseases affecting human beings , while the third facility , the Razi Institute for Serum and Vaccines focuses on diseases affecting both humans and other animals such as livestock .
The Razi and Pasteur Institutes have vaccine development and production experience dating back to the 1920s , and for many years both of these facilities were recognized among the most advanced of their kind in the developing world .
Today , all three facilities undertake projects requiring advanced microbiology and genetic engineering equipment and expertise that could be applied toward the production of biological weapons .
For instance , the NRCGEB 's research in recombinant DNA technologies , genetic engineering , and DNA vaccine production could conceivably be utilized to increase the virulence or resistance of select pathogens .
The equipment for mass - producing vaccines and antiserums at the Pasteur Institute could be utilized to mass - produce biological weapons as well .
As is evident from the contents of the Persian Type Culture Collection discussed below , Iran clearly has access to many dangerous pathogens .
Furthermore , Iran clearly possesses technology useful for producing biological weapons ( as will be elucidated in the Facilities section of this profile ) .
What remains unclear is whether Iran is indeed proceeding with a BW program .
Like many facilities throughout the United States and Western Europe that have similar or even more advanced capabilities , these facilities are open to public scrutiny .
Also , like many facilities in the West , Iran 's leading biotechnology research and development facilities create valuable vaccine products that are distributed in Iran and throughout the world .
Facilities
Amir Kabir University of Technology
Other Names : Tehran Polytechnic ; Amirkabir University of Technology
Address : Hafez Ave. , No. 424 , P.O. Box 15875-4413 Tehran , Iran
Subordinate to : Ministry of Culture and Higher Education
Size :
At present , Amir Kabir University ( AKU ) has 7000 students in undergraduate and post - graduate programs .
It has 14 engineering departments , five research centers , and an associate university complex located at the town of Tafresh near Tehran .
AKU employs 480 full - time teachers and 550 administrative employees .
Primary Function : Education , development of post - graduate studies , expansion of industrial and academic links , and establishment of new research laboratories .
History :
Founded in 1958 , AKU underwent a series of reforms after the revolution to align its teachings with Islamic principles .
The first independent biomedical engineering department in Iran was established at AKU in October 1993 .
Activities :
AKU 's Biomedical Engineering Department offers graduate programs in three major specialties -- Bioelectrics , Biomaterials , and Biomechanics -- which incorporate traditional engineering programs to address problems associated with human physiology , treatment , and rehabilitation .
AKU 's Biomaterials Laboratory is the largest university laboratory fostering research in the area of synthesis , processing , and modification of materials for use in biological environments .
This laboratory is especially active in the area of polymeric materials with the objective of modifying the physical , chemical , biological , and mechanical properties of polymeric materials to render them biocompatible .
The laboratory 's specific research areas include the design and processing of systems for controlled and targeted delivery of bioactive agents .
The university places emphasis on its strong relationship with the nation 's industries and the practical application of its training programs .
According to the National Council of Resistance of Iran , Iran has purchased dual - use equipment using the science and technology center at Amir Kabir University as a cover .
Middle East Defense News reports that AKU has been used as a front company to purchase the following equipment from the United States : computers , Unix software , and training from NCR , Apple Computer , and Sun Microsystems , and neutron - shielding from Reactor Experiments , Inc . None of these technologies appears to be directly related to biological weapons .
Additional Info :
In 2002 , AKU and Damascus University signed a mutual scientific cooperation agreement that called for broadened scientific , educational , and research cooperation between the universities , the exchange of professors and students , the organization of scientific seminars and educational courses , and the formation of a joint working committee to probe into the inauguration of a branch of Amir Kabir University in Syria .
Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing U.S. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage .
That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage .
`` Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies , '' said Noel D. Matchett , a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc. , Silver Spring , MD.
It `` may well be '' that theft of business data is `` as serious a strategic threat to national security '' as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms , said Michelle Van Cleave , the White House 's assistant director for National Security Affairs .
The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association , a joint industry-government trade group .
Any secret can be pirated , the experts said , if it is transmitted over the air .
Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder .
They need only position themselves near a company 's satellite dish and wait .
`` You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time , '' Mr . Matchett said , adding : `` It 's a pretty good bet they wo n't get caught .''
The only way to catch an electronic thief , he said , is to set him up with erroneous information .
Even though electronic espionage may cost U.S. firms billions of dollars a year , most are n't yet taking precautions , the experts said .
By contrast , European firms will spend $ 150 million this year on electronic security , and are expected to spend $ 1 billion by 1992 .
Already many foreign firms , especially banks , have their own cryptographers , conference speakers reported .
Still , encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy .
One expert , whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on condition that he would n't be named or quoted , said the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer-maintenance workers , for example , doubling as foreign spies .
Moreover , he said , technology now exists for stealing corporate secrets after they 've been `` erased '' from a computer 's memory .
He said that Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional committees to read .
No personal computer , not even the one on a chief executive 's desk , is safe , this speaker noted .
W. Mark Goode , president of Micronyx Inc. , a Richardson , Texas , firm that makes computer-security products , provided a new definition for Mikhail Gorbachev 's campaign for greater openness , known commonly as glasnost .
Under Mr . Gorbachev , Mr . Goode said , the Soviets are openly stealing Western corporate communications .
He cited the case of a Swiss oil trader who recently put out bids via telex for an oil tanker to pick up a cargo of crude in the Middle East .
Among the responses the Swiss trader got was one from the Soviet national shipping company , which had n't been invited to submit a bid .
The Soviets ' eavesdropping paid off , however , because they got the contract .
Firefighters rescue nearly a dozen animals in Buffalo , New York house fire
Buffalo , New York A three alarm fire at a house owned by John and Evelyn Bencinich , two of the initiators of a lawsuit filed against the Elmwood Village Hotel proposal in Buffalo , required firefighters to rescue eight cats and two dogs in Buffalo , New York today .
At about 8:30 ( eastern time ) firefighters were called to the home on 48 Granger Place to put out a fire that had started in the basement .
It quickly spread to the first floor where the main bathroom was destroyed .
The fire did not spread to the second floor or attic .
Initial calls said that many animals were inside the house and firefighters quickly worked to rescue all the cats and dogs .
At least one cat and one dog had to receive CPR and oxygen , but both are reported to be in stable condition .
At least 3 cats are unaccounted for , but after a search of the house , the cats were not believed to have been inside at the time the fire started .
One elderly woman , Anna Bencinich , the mother of Evelyn , was rescued by neighbors who helped her from the burning house .
'' There was smoke all over the house .
The fire started in the basement and spread to a small portion of the first floor .
Two firefighters were injured while fighting the fire and were transported to Erie County Medical Center , '' said Division Fire Chief Thomas Ashe who also said that sections of the kitchen wall at the back of the house had to be torn out to stop the fire from spreading through the walls .
One firefighter is being treated for bite injuries to his face that he received while attempting to rescue a dog .
The other firefighter was treated for injuries he received to his hand , which was believed to have been caused by glass or a cat scratching him .
The names of the injured firefighters are not known .
The injuries are said to not be life threatening .
According to witness reports , the home owners had a new water heater installed just last week , but it is not known if the fire was caused by the heater .
'' We believe the fire was caused by an electrical ( malfunction ) .
An investigation is being conducted , '' said Battalion Chief Joe Fahey who also added that they did not believe arson was the cause .
Inauguration of free zone in Dubai for e-commerce
Dubai 10-28 ( FP ) - Dubai 's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohamed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum inaugurated a free zone for e-commerce today , called Dubai Internet City .
The preliminary stages of the project , the only one of its kind according to its designers , are estimated at $200 million .
Sheikh Mohamed , who is also the Defense Minister of the United Arab Emirates , announced at the inauguration ceremony that `` we want to make Dubai a new trading center . ''
The minister , who has his own website , also said : `` I want Dubai to be the best place in the world for state-of-the-art technology companies . ''
He said companies engaged in e-commerce would be able to set up offices , employ staff and own equipment in the open zone , including fully-owned foreign companies .
The e-commerce free zone is situated in north Dubai , near the industrial free zone in Jebel Ali , the top regional and tenth international leading area in container transit .
The inauguration of Dubai Internet City coincides with the opening of an annual IT show in Dubai , the Gulf Information Technology Exhibition ( Gitex ) , the biggest in the Middle East .
It was a bright cold day in April , and the clocks were striking thirteen .
Winston Smith , his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind , slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions , though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him .
The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats .
At one end of it a coloured poster , too large for indoor display , had been tacked to the wall .
It depicted simply an enormous face , more than a metre wide : the face of a man of about forty-five , with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features .
Winston made for the stairs .
It was no use trying the lift .
Even at the best of times it was seldom working , and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours .
It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week .
The flat was seven flights up , and Winston , who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle , went slowly , resting several times on the way .
On each landing , opposite the lift-shaft , the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall .
It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move .
" Big Brother is watching you " , the caption beneath it ran .
Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron .
The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall .
Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat , though the words were still distinguishable .
The instrument ( the telescreen , it was called ) could be dimmed , but there was no way of shutting it off completely .
He moved over to the window : a smallish , frail figure , the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the Party .
His hair was very fair , his face naturally sanguine , his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended .
Canadian international merchandise trade
February 2002
Canada 's merchandise exports and imports posted increases in February as automobile assembly lines stepped up production after shutdowns in January .
Canadian companies exported $33.7 billion worth of goods , up 2.7% from January 's revised level , the largest monthly rate of growth since May 2000 .
Automotive products accounted for 25% of February 's total , compared with about 22% in January .
Merchandise imports , however , rose 5.1% from January , almost twice the pace of exports , to $29.1 billion .
It was the strongest monthly rate of growth in imports since August 1998 .
As a result , Canada 's trade surplus fell for the first time in four months to just over $4.5 billion in February from nearly $5.1 billion in January .
The trade surplus with the United States edged down about $33 million to $7.6 billion .
Canadian companies sent $28.5 billion in goods to the United States in February , up 1.6% from January revised level , while they imported $20.9 billion worth , up 2.4% .
The United States accounted for just over one-half of the increase in Canada 's exports in February , but only about one-third of the increase in imports .
Consequently , Canada 's total trade deficit with other nations widened by half a billion dollars from $2.6 billion to $3.1 billion in February .
Introduction
Iran 's chemical weapons and ballistic missiles , and possibly its nuclear weapon program and biological warfare capabilities , are meant to deter opponents and to gain influence in the Persian Gulf and Caspian Sea regions .
The acquisition and creation of these various weapon systems can also be seen as a response to Iran 's own experience as a victim of chemical and missile attacks during the Iran - Iraq War .
Nuclear
Iran possesses five research reactors and two partially constructed power reactors at Bushehr .
It acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) in 1970 .
In the mid - 1970s , Iran initiated a nuclear power program , though there are reports that it also began a small nuclear weapon research program at the same time .
The 1979 revolution ended all nuclear efforts until 1984 , when Iran revived the nuclear power program and reportedly began covert procurement for a nuclear weapon program .
Iran 's plans for building a civilian nuclear power program have prompted much concern regarding its intention to develop nuclear weapons .
Russia is assisting Iran to construct a light water reactor at Bushehr , which is now nearing completion , and will supply the nuclear fuel needed to run it .
Although the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) allows transfers of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes to non - nuclear weapon states , the United States has vehemently opposed the Russian - Iranian deal .
The United States believes that nuclear energy is not necessary in a country with Iran 's large oil supply .
It fears that the deal is being used as a cover for the transfer of more sensitive nuclear technology to Iran and to provide training for Iranian nuclear specialists that could be used to support a nuclear weapons program .
Russia , however , has expressed its intention to complete the deal .
Iran has denied the charges that it is pursuing a nuclear weapons program , and argues that nuclear technology for civilian use is the right of every non - nuclear weapon state party to the NPT .
American concerns over Iran 's nuclear program intensified in mid - 2002 , when American intelligence learned of the existence of two secret nuclear facilities .
According to an Iranian opposition group , the two sites , a uranium enrichment facility at Natanz and a heavy water production plant near Arak , had been funded by front companies .
In February 2003 , Iranian leaders announced a new plan to develop a nuclear energy plan using entirely domestic resources .
This development is of particular concern , considering the revelation of the two secret facilities .
The United States believes that these facilities might contribute to Iran 's development of a complete nuclear fuel cycle , which would enable Iran to build nuclear weapons without importing nuclear material .
Later in February 2003 , an IAEA delegation visited the pilot - scale gas centrifuge enrichment plant at Natanz , which is nearly ready for operation .
The inspection team learned that Iran has the capability to build more centrifuges .
During the IAEA 's visit to Iran , Iranian officials indicated that Iran would honor its safeguards agreement with the IAEA , but did not clearly indicate Iran 's willingness to accept the Additional Protocol .
This means that Iran will place the Natanz facility , and any enriched uranium it produces , under IAEA inspection but that , as long as no nuclear materials are present , the IAEA would have no ability to examine locations in Iran where it believed nuclear weapons design research might be under way .
The United States is concerned that if Iran stockpiled enriched uranium , it might , in the future , withdraw from the NPT ( as North Korea has ) and then build nuclear weapons rapidly , perhaps even in a matter of months .
It is possible that construction of the Natanz plant violated Iran 's IAEA safeguards obligations .
Such a violation would have occurred if Iran introduced nuclear material into the facility to test it , without informing the IAEA .
Reports in the Western media in March 2003 charged that Iran may have taken this step .
Iran responded by strenuously denying the charges , but also maintained that it reserved the right to possess nuclear weapons to counter Israel 's weaponry .
An Iranian initiative to normalize relations was communicated to the United States in May 2003 .
It includes a promise to address U.S. concerns on nuclear weapons in exchange for lifting sanctions and eventual normalization of relations .
To date , the United States has not responded to the offer .
However , intense U.S. pressure for Iran to prove it had no secret atomic weapons program culminated in a toughly worded UN resolution in September 2003 , prompting a walkout and subsequent freeze on nuclear inspections by Iran .
In February 2004 , it was revealed that HEU traces detected by IAEA inspectors twelve months previously -- in at least two different sites -- were pure enough to produce nuclear weaponry .
In March 2004 , the revelation , combined with IAEA evidence that nuclear activities had been pursued on Iranian military bases , led to a first - ever acknowledgment by Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani that the Iranian military had produced centrifuges to enrich uranium .
Iran continues to assert , however , that its nuclear program is for the generation of electricity alone .
In April 2004 , Iran vowed to step up cooperation with the IAEA , adding that it had not only suspended enrichment programs but also stopped producing and assembling related parts .
Iran agreed to an IAEA inspection schedule and to a mid - May 2004 deadline for the submission of complete details regarding its nuclear program and goals .
Biological
There is very little publicly available information to determine whether Iran is pursuing a biological weapon program .
Although Iran acceded to the Geneva Protocol in 1929 and ratified the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention ( BWC ) in 1973 , the U.S. government believes Iran began biological weapon efforts in the early to mid - 1980s , and that it continues to pursue an offensive biological weapon program linked to its civilian biotechnology activities .
The United States alleges that Iran may have started to develop small quantities of agent , possibly including mycotoxins , ricin , and the smallpox virus .
Iran strongly denies acquiring or producing biological weapons .
Chemical
There is limited open - source information available concerning Iran 's chemical weapons program .
Although Iran ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) in November 1997 , the United States believes that Iran has maintained a chemical weapons program since 1984 , including production of sarin , mustard , phosgene , and hydrocyanic acid .
According to U.S. government estimates , Iran can produce 1,000 metric tons of agent per year and may have a stockpile of at least several thousand metric tons of weaponized and bulk agent .
Iran strongly denies acquiring or producing chemical weapons .
Missile
Iran possesses one of the largest missile inventories in the Middle East and has acquired complete missile systems and developed an infrastructure to build missiles indigenously .
It has purchased North Korean Scud-Bs , Scud-Cs , and Nodong ballistic missiles .
Meanwhile , Iran has also developed short - range artillery rockets and is producing the Scud-B and the Scud-C -- called the Shehab-1 and Shehab-2 , respectively .
Iran recently flight - tested the 1,300 km - range Shehab-3 , which is based on the North Korean Nodong .
The Shehab-3 is capable of reaching Israel .
Following this most recent flight - test , the Shehab-3 was placed in service and revolutionary guard units were officially armed with the missiles .
There are conflicting reports about the development of even longer - ranged missiles , such as the Shehab-4 and the Kosar intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) .
U.S. intelligence agencies assess that barring acquisition of a complete system or major subsystem from North Korea , Iran is unlikely to launch an ICBM or satellite launch vehicle ( SLV ) before mid - decade .
At present , Iran 's capabilities in missile production have kept in line with its doctrine of protection from regional threats .
Iran has developed new missiles including the Ra'ad and Kosar and continues to test its Nodong based , Shehab-3 missile .
On October 20, 2004 , Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani confirmed the latest successful test of Iran 's Shehab-3 with a 2,000 - kilometer range in front of observers .
Iran has openly declared its ability to mass produce the Shehab-3 medium - range missile .
Intelligence reports regarding Iran 's expansion of capabilities and persistent interest in acquiring new technologies have led the United States to seek other options in dealing with Iran as a regional threat .

Introduction
South Africa 's nuclear , biological , chemical , and missile programs reflected perceptions of internal and external threats stemming from its former government 's policy of apartheid , as well as the country 's advanced state of technical development .
Pretoria developed nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles but relinquished these armaments in the early 1990s .
The apartheid government also undertook a chemical and biological weapons ( CBW ) defense program , which reportedly also included offensive research and use of CBW agents against opponents of that government .
While the proliferation legacies of South Africa 's nuclear and missile programs were effectively resolved through verified disarmament measures that won international acclaim , dismantlement of the country 's CBW capabilities was not verified to a comparable degree of certainty .
The post - apartheid government of South Africa implemented its nonproliferation and disarmament policy through the Non - Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction Act ( No. 87 of 1993 ) to control the transfer of sensitive items and technologies .
South Africa is the first and , to date , only country to build a nuclear arsenal , and then voluntarily dismantle its entire nuclear weapons program .
The South African experience demonstrates that at least under some conditions , unilateral disarmament is not only possible , but can improve a nation 's security .
Nuclear
In the 1960s , South Africa began to explore the technical utility of `` peaceful nuclear explosions '' for mining and engineering purposes .
In 1973 , then Prime Minister Johannes Vorster approved a program to develop a limited nuclear deterrent capability .
Ultimately , South Africa manufactured six air - deliverable nuclear weapons of the `` gun - type '' design .
In parallel with decisions to end apartheid , the government halted the bomb program in 1989 and dismantled existing weapons and associated production equipment .
South Africa acceded to the Treaty on the Non - Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) as a non - nuclear weapon state in 1991 , and International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) inspectors subsequently verified the completeness of its nuclear dismantlement .
South Africa joined the Zangger Committee in 1994 and the Nuclear Suppliers Group in 1995 .
South Africa was instrumental in winning indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995 , and played a leading role in successful conclusion of the 2000 NPT Review Conference as a member of the `` New Agenda Coalition '' that also included Brazil , Egypt , Ireland , Mexico , New Zealand , and Sweden .
More recently , South Africa began working more closely with the IAEA in 2004 , in order to monitor international smuggling of nuclear weapons materials , after investigations of a South African businessman exposed connections to the A.Q. Khan network .
In 2004 , there was also ample discussion concerning South Africa 's dwindling coal reserves and its need for additional nuclear power generation .
Biological
South Africa 's biological weapons program was one of the two principal components of its covert state - sponsored CBW program , codenamed Project Coast ( later Project Jota ) .
Personnel associated with Coast have characterized it as the most sophisticated program of its type outside of the former Soviet Union , but international CBW experts generally consider it to have been considerably less advanced from a scientific standpoint .
Although ostensibly created entirely for defensive purposes , since government and Cuban military forces in Angola were reportedly equipped for and planning to use -- if not already using -- CW agents against the South African Defence Force ( SADF ) , from the outset the program also had offensive features and capabilities .
The apartheid - era South African government viewed itself as the target of a `` total onslaught '' by Soviet-backed Marxist guerrillas or regimes in neighboring states and black nationalists at home , and to meet this all - encompassing `` red - black danger '' it was apparently willing to use almost any means at its disposal to defend itself .
It was in this highly charged political and military context , which precipitated a `` bunker '' or `` laager '' mentality , that Coast was secretly initiated in 1981 under the aegis of the SADF Special Forces .
The chief facility for researching , producing , and testing BW agents and lethal toxic chemicals was a military front company called Roodeplaat Research Laboratories , located north of Pretoria , and other facilities were established to develop protective clothing and manufacture exotic assassination devices .
Project Officer Dr . Wouter Basson also set up an elaborate network of procurement and financial front companies overseas .
During its existence Coast scientists tested or developed a wide range of harmful BW agents , including Bacillus anthracis , botulinum toxin , Vibrio cholerae , Clostridium perfringens , plague bacteria , and salmonella bacteria .
Some of these pathogens were probably used to assassinate individual `` enemies of the state , '' and it is alleged that both anthrax bacteria and V. cholerae were each employed on at least one occasion to infect larger populations .
The CBW program was officially dismantled in 1993 , in the midst of a liberalizing transformation of the regime .
There are indications , however , that certain personnel who were intimately involved in the program , including Basson , may have provided technical knowledge , equipment , or materials to `` rogue regimes '' such as Libya , to foreign intelligence personnel , to unscrupulous black marketers trafficking in dangerous weapons , and perhaps also -- if certain journalists can be believed -- to elements of a shadowy international network of right - wing extremists .
These claims have yet to be fully investigated , much less verified .
The extent to which various foreign governments , military establishments , and intelligence agencies secretly monitored or covertly assisted in the development of the program likewise remains an open question .
Chemical
South Africa 's chemical warfare program was one of the two principal components of its covert state - sponsored CBW program , codenamed Project Coast ( later Project Jota ) .
Personnel associated with Coast have characterized it as the most sophisticated program of its type outside of the former Soviet Union , but international CBW experts generally consider it to have been considerably less advanced from a scientific standpoint .
Although ostensibly created entirely for defensive purposes , since government and Cuban military forces in Angola were reportedly equipped for and planning to use -- if not already using -- CW agents against the South African Defence Force ( SADF ) , from the outset the program also had offensive features and capabilities .
The apartheid - era South African government viewed itself as the target of a `` total onslaught '' by Soviet - backed Marxist guerrillas or regimes in neighboring states and black nationalists at home , and to meet this all - encompassing `` red - black danger '' it was apparently willing to use almost any means at its disposal to defend itself .
It was in this highly charged political and military context , which precipitated a `` bunker '' or `` laager '' mentality , that Coast was secretly initiated in 1981 under the aegis of the SADF Special Forces .
The chief facility for researching and producing CW agents was a military front company called Delta G Scientific , located between Johannesburg and Pretoria , and several other facilities were set up to develop protective clothing , manufacture exotic assassination devices , and `` weaponize '' irritants ( Riot Control Agents such as CS and CR ) and incapacitants by placing them in artillery shells , mortar bombs , and grenades .
Project Officer Dr . Wouter Basson also set up an elaborate network of procurement and financial front companies overseas .
During its existence Coast scientists tested and developed both small quantities of well - known CW agents ( including mustard agent , sarin , tabun , BZ , and perhaps VX ) and a host of lethal , hard - to - trace toxic chemicals .
Several of these latter , above all the toxic organophosphates , were almost certainly employed to assassinate individual `` enemies of the state . ''
Certain CW facilities also carried out research on the suitability of using illegal drugs such as methaqualone ( `` Quaaludes '' ) , MDMA ( `` Ecstasy '' ) , LSD , marijuana extract ( tetrahydrocannibol ) , and cocaine as incapacitating `` calmatives , '' but some of these illegal drugs may have ended up being sold for a profit .
The CBW program was officially dismantled in 1993 , in the midst of a liberalizing transformation of the regime .
There are indications , however , that certain personnel who were intimately involved in the program , including Basson , may have provided technical knowledge , equipment , or materials to `` rogue regimes '' such as Libya , to foreign intelligence personnel , to unscrupulous black marketers trafficking in dangerous weapons , and perhaps also -- if certain journalists can be believed -- to elements of a shadowy international network of right - wing extremists .
These claims have yet to be fully investigated , much less verified .
The extent to which various foreign governments , military establishments , and intelligence agencies secretly monitored or covertly assisted in the development of the program likewise remains an open question .
Missile
It is not clear when South Africa began ballistic missile - related efforts , but reportedly by the mid - 1980s , some missile infrastructure existed in the country .
It appears that Israel collaborated with South Africa in development of this program , but the nature and extent of this relationship is unknown .
Following a July 1989 flight - test of what Pretoria described as a `` booster rocket '' in a space - launch program , U.S. intelligence noted striking similarities between this system and Israel 's intermediate - range Jericho - 2 ballistic missile .
Facing U.S. opposition to missile proliferation and the end of its apartheid government , South Africa abandoned its missile and space launch programs in 1991 and dismantled associated facilities under international observation .
South Africa became a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) in 1995 .
A cold and melancholy walk of a couple of miles brought us to a high wooden gate , which opened into a gloomy avenue of chestnuts .
The curved and shadowed drive led us to a low , dark house , pitchblack against a slate-coloured sky .
From the front window upon the left of the door there peeped a glimmer of a feeble light .
" There 's a constable in possession , " said Baynes .
" I 'll knock at the window . "
He stepped across the grass plot and tapped with his hand on the pane .
Through the fogged glass I dimly saw a man spring up from a chair beside the fire , and heard a sharp cry from within the room .
An instant later a white-faced , hardbreathing policeman had opened the door , the candle wavering in his trembling hand .
" What 's the matter , Walters ? " asked Baynes sharply .
The man mopped his forehead with his handkerchief and agave a long sigh of relief .
" I am glad you have come , sir .
It has been a long evening , and I don 't think my nerve is as good as it was . "
" Your nerve , Walters ?
I should not have thought you had a nerve in your body . "
" Well , sir , it 's this lonely , silent house and the queer thing in the kitchen .
Then when you tapped at the window I thought it had come again . "
" That what had come again ? "
" The devil , sir , for all I know .
It was at the window . "
" What was at the window , and when ? "
" It was just about two hours ago .
The light was just fading .
I was sitting reading in the chair .
I don 't know what made me look up , but there was a face looking in at me through the lower pane .
Lord , sir , what a face it was !
I 'll see it in my dreams . "
" Tut , tut , Walters .
This is not talk for a police-constable . "
" I know , sir , I know ; but it shook me , sir , and there 's no use to deny it .
It wasn 't black , sir , nor was it white , nor any colour that I know but a kind of queer shade like clay with a splash of milk in it .
Then there was the size of it - it was twice yours , sir .
And the look of it - the great staring goggle eyes , and the line of white teeth like a hungry beast .
I tell you , sir , I couldn 't move a finger , nor get my breath , till it whisked away and was gone .
Out I ran and through the shrubbery , but thank God there was no one there . "
" If I didn 't know you were a good man , Walters , I should put a black mark against you for this .
If it were the devil himself a constable on duty should never thank God that he could not lay his hands upon him .
I suppose the whole thing is not a vision and a touch of nerves ? "
" That , at least , is very easily settled , " said Holmes , lighting his little pocket lantern .
" Yes , " he reported , after a short examination of the grass bed , " a number twelve shoe , I should say .
If he was all on the same scale as his foot he must certainly have been a giant . "
" What became of him ? "
" He seems to have broken through the shrubbery and made for the road . "
" Well , " said the inspector with a grave and thoughtful face , " whoever he may have been , and whatever he may have wanted , he 's gone for the present , and we have more immediate things to attend to .
Now , Mr . Holmes , with your permission , I will show you round the house . "
The various bedrooms and sitting-rooms had yielded nothing to a careful search .
Apparently the tenants had brought little or nothing with them , and all the furniture down to the smallest details had been taken over with the house .
A good deal of clothing with the stamp of Marx and Co .
, High Holborn , had been left behind .
Telegraphic inquiries had been already made which showed that Marx knew nothing of his customer save that he was a good payer .
Odds and ends , some pipes , a few novels , two of them in Spanish , and old-fashioned pinfire revolver , and a guitar were among the personal property .
" Nothing in all this , " said Baynes , stalking , candle in hand , from room to room .
" But now , Mr . Holmes , I invite your attention to the kitchen . "
It was a gloomy , high-ceilinged room at the back of the house , with a straw litter in one corner , which served apparently as a bed for the cook .
The table was piled with half-eaten dishes and dirty plates , the debris of last night 's dinner .
" Look at this , " said Baynes .
" What do you make of it ? "
He held up his candle before an extraordinary object which stood at the back of the dresser .
It was so wrinkled and shrunken and withered that it was difficult to say what it might have been .
One could but say that it was black and leathery and that it bore some resemblance to a dwarfish , human figure .
At first , as I examined it , I thought that it was a mummified negro baby , and then it seemed a very twisted and ancient monkey .
Finally I was left in doubt as to whether it was animal or human .
A double band of white shells were strung round the centre of it .
" Very interesting - very interesting , indeed ! " said Holmes , peering at this sinister relic .
" Anything more ? "
In silence Baynes led the way to the sink and held forward his candle .
The limbs and body of some large , white bird , torn savagely to pieces with the feathers still on , were littered all over it .
Holmes pointed to the wattles on the severed head .
" A white cock , " said he .
" Most interesting !
It is really a very curious case . "
But Mr . Baynes had kept his most sinister exhibit to the last .
From under the sink he drew a zinc pail which contained a quantity of blood .
Then from the table he took a platter heaped with small pieces of charred bone .
" Something has been killed and something has been burned .
We raked all these out of the fire .
We had a doctor in this morning .
He says that they are not human . "
Holmes smiled and rubbed his hands .
" I must congratulate you , Inspector , on handling so distinctive and instructive a case .
Your powers , if I may say so without offence , seem superior to your opportunities . "
Inspector Baynes 's small eyes twinkled with pleasure .
" You 're right , Mr . Holmes .
We stagnate in the provinces .
A case of this sort gives a man a chance , and I hope that I shall take it .
What do you make of these bones ? "
" A lamb , I should say , or a kid . "
" And the white cock ? "
" Curious , Mr . Baynes , very curious .
I should say almost unique . "
" Yes , sir , there must have been some very strange people with some very strange ways in this house .
One of them is dead .
Did his companions follow him and kill him ?
If they did we should have them , for every port is watched .
But my own views are different .
Yes , sir , my own views are very different . "
" You have a theory then ? "
" And I 'll work it myself , Mr . Holmes .
It 's only due to my own credit to do so .
Your name is made , but I have still to make mine .
I should be glad to be able to say afterwards that I had solved it without your help . "
Holmes laughed good-humoredly .
" Well , well , Inspector , " said he .
" Do you follow your path and I will follow mine .
My results are always very much at your service if you care to apply to me for them .
I think that I have seen all that I wish in this house , and that my time may be more profitably employed elsewhere .
Au revoir and good luck ! "
I could tell by numerous subtle signs , which might have been lost upon anyone but myself , that Holmes was on a hot scent .
As impassive as ever to the casual observer , there were none the less a subdued eagerness and suggestion of tension in his brightened eyes and brisker manner which assured me that the game was afoot .
After his habit he said nothing , and after mine I asked no questions .
Sufficient for me to share the sport and lend my humble help to the capture without distracting that intent brain with needless interruption .
All would come round to me in due time .
I waited , therefore - but to my ever-deepening disappointment I waited in vain .
Day succeeded day , and my friend took no step forward .
One morning he spent in town , and I learned from a casual reference that he had visited the British Museum .
Save for this one excursion , he spent his days in long and often solitary walks , or in chatting with a number of village gossips whose acquaintance he had cultivated .
" I 'm sure , Watson , a week in the country will be invaluable to you , " he remarked .
" It is very pleasant to see the first green shoots upon the hedges and the catkins on the hazels once again .
With a spud , a tin box , and an elementary book on botany , there are instructive days to be spent . "
He prowled about with this equipment himself , but it was a poor show of plants which he would bring back of an evening .
Occasionally in our rambles we came across Inspector Baynes .
His fat , red face wreathed itself in smiles and his small eyes glittered as he greeted my companion .
He said little about the case , but from that little we gathered that he also was not dissatisfied at the course of events .
I must admit , however , that I was somewhat surprised when , some five days after the crime , I opened my morning paper to find in large letters :
Holmes sprang in his chair as if he had been stung when I read the headlines .
" By Jove ! " he cried .
" You don 't mean that Baynes has got him ? "
" Apparently , " said I as I read the following report :
" Great excitement was caused in Esher and the neighbouring district when it was learned late last night that an arrest had been effected in connection with the Oxshott murder .
It will be remembered that Mr . Garcia , of Wisteria Lodge , was found dead on Oxshott Common , his body showing signs of extreme violence , and that on the same night his servant and his cook fled , which appeared to show their participation in the crime .
It was suggested , but never proved , that the deceased gentleman may have had valuables in the house , and that their abstraction was the motive of the crime .
Every effort was made by Inspector Baynes , who has the case in hand , to ascertain the hiding place of the fugitives , and he had good reason to believe that they had not gone far but were lurking in some retreat which had been already prepared .
It was certain from the first , however , that they would eventually be detected , as the cook , from the evidence of one or two tradespeople who have caught a glimpse of him through the window , was a man of most remarkable appearance - being a huge and hideous mulatto , with yellowish features of a pronounced negroid type .
This man has been seen since the crime , for he was detected and pursued by Constable Walters on the same evening , when he had the audacity to revisit Wisteria Lodge .
Inspector Baynes , considering that such a visit must have some purpose in view and was likely , therefore , to be repeated , abandoned the house but left an ambuscade in the shrubbery .
The man walked into the trap and was captured last night after a struggle in which Constable Downing was badly bitten by the savage .
We understand that when the prison is brought before the magistrates a remand will be applied for by the police , and that great developments are hoped from his capture . "
" Really we must see Baynes at once , " cried Holmes , picking up his hat .
" We will just catch him before he starts . "
We hurried down the village street and found , as we had expected , that the inspector was just leaving his lodgings .
" You 've seen the paper , Mr . Holmes ? " he asked , holding one out to us .
" Yes , Baynes , I 've seen it .
Pray don 't think it a liberty if I give you a word of friendly warning . "
" Of warning , Mr . Holmes ? "
" I have looked into this case with some care , and I am not convinced that you are on the right lines .
I don 't want you to commit yourself too far unless you are sure . "
" You 're very kind , Mr . Holmes . "
" I assure you I speak for your good . "
It seemed to me that something like a wink quivered for an instant over one of Mr . Baynes 's tiny eyes .
" We agreed to work on our own lines , Mr . Holmes .
That 's what I am doing . "
" Oh , very good , " said Holmes .
" Don 't blame me . "
" No , sir ; I believe you mean well by me .
But we all have our own systems , Mr . Holmes .
You have yours , and maybe I have mine . "
" Let us say no more about it . "
" You 're welcome always to my news .
This fellow is a perfect savage , as strong as a cart-horse and as fierce as the devil .
He chewed Downing 's thumb nearly off before they could master him .
He hardly speaks a word of English , and we can get nothing out of him but grunts . "
" And you think you have evidence that he murdered his late master ? "
" I didn 't say so , Mr . Holmes ; I didn 't say so .
We all have our little ways .
You try yours and I will try mine .
That 's the agreement . "
Holmes shrugged his shoulders as we walked away together .
" I can 't make the man out .
He seems to be riding for a fall .
Well , as he says , we must each try our own way and see what comes of it .
But there 's something in Inspector Baynes which I can 't quite understand . "
" Just sit down in that chair , Watson , " said Sherlock Holmes when we had returned to our apartment at the Bull .
" I want to put you in touch with the situation , as I may need your help to-night .
Let me show you the evolution of this case so far as I have been able to follow it .
Simple as it has been in its leading features , it has none the less presented surprising difficulties in the way of an arrest .
There are gaps in that direction which we have still to fill .
" We will go back to the note which was handed in to Garcia upon the evening of his death .
We may put aside this idea of Baynes 's that Garcia 's servants were concerned in the matter .
The proof of this lies in the fact that it was H E who had arranged for the presence of Scott Eccles , which could only have been done for the purpose of an alibi .
It was Garcia , then , who had an enterprise , and apparently a criminal enterprise , in hand that night in the course of which he met his death .
I say 'criminal ' because only a man with a criminal enterprise desires to establish an alibi .
Who , then , is most likely to have taken his life ?
Surely the person against whom the criminal enterprise was directed .
So far it seems to me that we are on safe ground .
" We can now see a reason for the disappearance of Garcia 's household .
They were A L L confederates in the same unknown crime .
If it came off when Garcia returned , any possible suspicion would be warded off by the Englishman 's evidence , and all would be well .
But the attempt was a dangerous one , and if Garcia did N O T return by a certain hour it was probable that his own life had been sacrificed .
It had been arranged , therefore , that in such a case his two subordinates were to make for some prearranged spot where they could escape investigation and be in a position afterwards to renew their attempt .
That would fully explain the facts , would it not ? "
The whole inexplicable tangle seemed to straighten out before me .
I wondered , as I always did , how it had not been obvious to me before .
" But why should one servant return ? "
" We can imagine that in the confusion of flight something precious , something which he could not bear to part with , had been left behind .
That would explain his persistence , would it not ? "
" Well , what is the next step ? "
" The next step is the note received by Garcia at the dinner .
It indicates a confederate at the other end .
Now , where was the other end ?
I have already shown you that it could only lie in some large house , and that the number of large houses is limited .
My first days in this village were devoted to a series of walks in which in the intervals of my botanical researches I made a reconnaissance of all the large houses and an examination of the family history of the occupants .
One house , and only one , riveted my attention .
It is the famous old Jacobean grange of High Gable , one mile on the farther side of Oxshott , and less than half a mile from the scene of the tragedy .
The other mansions belonged to prosaic and respectable people who live far aloof from romance .
But Mr . Henderson , of High Gable , was by all accounts a curious man to whom curious adventures might befall .
I concentrated my attention , therefore , upon him and his household .
" A singular set of people , Watson - the man himself the most singular of them all .
I managed to see him on a plausible pretext , but I seemed to read in his dark , deepset , brooding eyes that he was perfectly aware of my true business .
He is a man of fifty , strong , active , with iron-gray hair , great bunched black eyebrows , the step of a deer and the air of an emperor - a fierce , masterful man , with a red-hot spirit behind his parchment face .
He is either a foreigner or has lived long in the tropics , for he is yellow and sapless , but tough as whipcord .
His friend and secretary , Mr . Lucas , is undoubtedly a foreigner , chocolate brown , wily , suave , and catlike , with a poisonous gentleness of speech .
You see , Watson , we have come already upon two sets of foreigners - one at Wisteria Lodge and one at High Gable - so our gaps are beginning to close .
" These two men , close and confidential friends , are the centre of the household ; but there is one other person who for our immediate purpose may be even more important .
Henderson has two children - girls of eleven and thirteen .
Their governess is a Miss Burnet , an Englishwoman of forty or thereabouts .
There is also one confidential manservant .
This little group forms the real family , for their travel about together , and Henderson is a great traveller , always on the move .
It is only within the last weeks that he has returned , after a year 's absence , to High Gable .
I may add that he is enormously rich , and whatever his whims may be he can very easily satisfy them .
For the rest , his house is full of butlers , footmen , maidservants , and the usual overfed , underworked staff of a large English country house .
" So much I learned partly from village gossip and partly from my own observation .
There are no better instruments than discharged servants with a grievance , and I was lucky enough to find one .
I call it luck , but it would not have come my way had I not been looking out for it .
As Baynes remarks , we all have our systems .
It was my system which enabled me to find John Warner , late gardener of High Gable , sacked in a moment of temper by his imperious employer .
He in turn had friends among the indoor servants who unite in their fear and dislike of their master .
So I had my key to the secrets of the establishment .
" Curious people , Watson !
I don 't pretend to understand it all yet , but very curious people anyway .
It 's a double-winged house , and the servants live on one side , the family on the other .
There 's no link between the two save for Henderson 's own servant , who serves the family 's meals .
Everything is carried to a certain door , which forms the one connection .
Governess and children hardly go out at all , except into the garden .
Henderson never by any chance walks alone .
His dark secretary is like his shadow .
The gossip among the servants is that their master is terribly afraid of something .
'Sold his soul to the devil in exchange for money , ' says Warner , 'and expects his creditor to come up and claim his own . '
Where they came from , or who they are , nobody has an idea .
They are very violent .
Twice Henderson has lashed at folk with his dog-whip , and only his long purse and heavy compensation have kept him out of the courts .
" Well , now , Watson , let us judge the situation by this new information .
We may take it that the letter came out of this strange household and was an invitation to Garcia to carry out some attempt which had already been planned .
Who wrote the note ?
It was someone within the citadel , and it was a woman .
Who then but Miss Burnet , the governess ?
All our reasoning seems to point that way .
At any rate , we may take it asa hypothesis and see what consequences it would entail .
I may add that Miss Burnet 's age and character make it certain that my first idea that there might be a love interest in our story is out of the question .
" If she wrote the note she was presumably the friend and confederate of Garcia .
What , then , might she be expected to do if she heard of his death ?
If he met it in some nefarious enterprise her lips might be sealed .
Still , in her heart , she must retain bitterness and hatred against those who had killed him and would presumably help so far as she could to have revenge upon them .
Could we see her , then and try to use her ?
That was my first thought .
But now we come to a sinister fact .
Miss Burnet has not been seen by any human eye since the night of the murder .
From that evening she has utterly vanished .
Is she alive ?
Has she perhaps met her end on the same night as the friend whom she had summoned ?
Or is she merely a prisoner ?
There is the point which we still have to decide .
" You will appreciate the difficulty of the situation , Watson .
There is nothing upon which we can apply for a warrant .
Our whole scheme might seem fantastic if laid before a magistrate .
The woman 's disappearance counts for nothing , since in that extraordinary household any member of it might be invisible for a week .
And yet she may at the present moment be in danger of her life .
All I can do is to watch the house and leave my agent , Warner , on guard at the gates .
We can 't let such a situation continue .
If the law can do nothing we must take the risk ourselves . "
" What do you suggest ? "
" I know which is her room .
It is accessible from the top of an outhouse .
My suggestion is that you and I go to-night and see if we can strike at the very heart of the mystery . "
It was not , I must confess , a very alluring prospect .
The old house with its atmosphere of murder , the singular and formidable inhabitants , the unknown dangers of the approach , and the fact that we were putting ourselves legally in a false position all combined to damp my ardour .
But there was something in the icecold reasoning of Holmes which made it impossible to shrink from any adventure which he might recommend .
One knew that thus , and only thus , could a solution be found .
I clasped his hand in silence , and the die was cast .
But it was not destined that our investigation should have so adventurous an ending .
It was about five o 'clock , and the shadows of the March evening were beginning to fall , when an excited rustic rushed into our room .
" They 've gone , Mr . Holmes .
They went by the last train .
The lady broke away , and I 've got her in a cab downstairs . "
" Excellent , Warner ! " cried Holmes , springing to his feet .
" Watson , the gaps are closing rapidly . "
In the cab was a woman , half-collapsed from nervous exhaustion .
She bore upon her aquiline and emaciated face the traces of some recent tragedy .
Her head hung listlessly upon her breast , but as she raised it and turned her dull eyes upon us I saw that her pupils were dark dots in the centre of the broad gray iris .
She was drugged with opium .
" I watched at the gate , same as you advised , Mr . Holmes , " said our emissary , the discharged gardener .
" When the carriage came out I followed it to the station .
She was like one walking in her sleep , but when they tried to get her into the train she came to life and struggled .
They pushed her into the carriage .
She fought her way out again .
I took her part , got her into a cab , and here we are .
I shan 't forget the face at the carriage window as I led her away .
I 'd have a short life if he had his way - the black-eyed , scowling , yellow devil . "
We carried her upstairs , laid her on the sofa , and a couple of cups of the strongest coffee soon cleared her brain from the mists of the drug .
Baynes had been summoned by Holmes , and the situation rapidly explained to him .
" Why , sir , you 've got me the very evidence I want , " said the inspector warmly , shaking my friend by the hand .
" I was on the same scent as you from the first . "
" What !
You were after Henderson ? "
" Why , Mr . Holmes , when you were crawling in the shrubbery at High Gable I was up one of the trees in the plantation and saw you down below .
It was just who would get his evidence first . "
" Then why did you arrest the mulatto ? "
Baynes chuckled .
" I was sure Henderson , as he calls himself , felt that he was suspected , and that he would lie low and make no move so long as he thought he was in any danger .
I arrested the wrong man to make him believe that our eyes were off him .
I knew he would be likely to clear off then and give us a chance of getting at Miss Burnet . "
Holmes laid his hand upon the inspector 's shoulder .
" You will rise high in your profession .
You have instinct and intuition , " said he .
Baynes flushed with pleasure .
" I 've had a plain-clothes man waiting at the station all the week .
Wherever the High Gable folk go he will keep them in sight .
But he must have been hard put to it when Miss Burnet broke away .
However , your man picked her up , and it all ends well .
We can 't arrest without her evidence , that is clear , so the sooner we get a statement the better . "
" Every minute she gets stronger , " said Holmes , glancing at the governess .
" But tell me , Baynes , who is this man Henderson ? "
" Henderson , " the inspector answered , " is Don Murillo , once call the Tiger of San Pedro . "
The Tiger of San Pedro !
The whole history of the man came back to me in a flash .
He had made his name as the most lewd and bloodthirsty tyrant that had ever governed any country with a pretence to civilization .
Strong , fearless , and energetic , he had sufficient virtue to enable him to impose his odious vices upon a cowering people for ten or twelve years .
His name was a terror through all Central America .
At the end of that time there was a universal rising against him .
But he was as cunning as he was cruel , and at the first whisper of coming trouble he had secretly conveyed his treasures aboard a ship which was manned by devoted adherents .
It was an empty palace which was stormed by the insurgents next day .
The dictator , his two children , his secretary , and his wealth had all escaped them .
From that moment he had vanished from the world , and his identity had been a frequent subject for comment in the European press .
" Yes , sir , Don Murillo , the Tiger of San Pedro , " said Baynes .
" If you look it up you will find that the San Pedro colours are green and white , same as in the note , Mr . Holmes .
Henderson he called himself , but I traced him back , Paris and Rome and Madrid to Barcelona , where his ship came in in '86 .
They 've been looking for him all the time for their revenge , but it is only now that they have begun to find him out . "
" They discovered him a year ago , " said Miss Burnet , who had sat up and was now intently following the conversation .
" Once already his life has been attempted , but some evil spirit shielded him .
Now , again , it is the noble , chivalrous Garcia who has fallen , while the monster goes safe .
But another will come , and yet another , until some day justice will be done ; that is as certain as the rise of to-morrow 's sun . "
Her thin hands clenched , and her worn face blanched with the passion of her hatred .
" But how come you into this matter , Miss Burnet ? " asked Holmes .
" How can an English lady join in such a murderous affair ? "
" I join in it because there is no other way in the world by which justice can be gained .
What does the law of England care for the rivers of blood shed years ago in San Pedro , or for the shipload of treasure which this man has stolen ?
To you they are like crimes committed in some other planet .
But W E know .
We have learned the truth in sorrow and in suffering .
To us there is no fiend in hell like Juan Murillo , and no peace in life while his victims still cry for vengeance . "
" No doubt , " said Holmes , " he was as you say .
I have heard that he was atrocious .
But how are you affected ? "
" I will tell you it all .
This villain 's policy was to murder , on one pretext or another , every man who showed such promise that he might in time come to be a dangerous rival .
My husband - yes , my real name is Signora Victor Durando - was the San Pedro minister in London .
He met me and married me there .
A nobler man never lived upon earth .
Unhappily , Murillo heard of his excellence , recalled him on some pretext , and had him shot .
With a premonition of his fate he had refused to take me with him .
His estates were confiscated , and I was left with a pittance and a broken heart .
" Then came the downfall of the tyrant .
He escaped as you have just described .
But the many whose lives he had ruined , whose nearest and dearest had suffered torture and death at his hands , would not let the matter rest .
They banded themselves into a society which should never be dissolved until the work was done .
It was my part after we had discovered in the transformed Henderson the fallen despot , to attach myself to his household and keep the others in touch with his movements .
This I was able to do by securing the position of governess in his family .
He little knew that the woman who faced him at every meal was the woman whose husband he had hurried at an hour 's notice into eternity .
I smiled on him , did my duty to his children , and bided my time .
An attempt was made in Paris and failed .
We zigzagged swiftly here and there over Europe to throw off the pursuers and finally returned to this house , which he had taken upon his first arrival in England .
" But here also the ministers of justice were waiting .
Knowing that he would return there , Garcia , who is the son of the former highest dignitary in San Pedro , was waiting with two trusty companions of humble station , all three fired with the same reasons for revenge .
He could do little during the day , for Murillo took every precaution and never went out save with his satellite Lucas , or Lopez as he was known in the days of his greatness .
At night , however , he slept alone , and the avenger might find him .
On a certain evening , which had been prearranged , I sent my friend final instructions , for the man was forever on the alert and continually changed his room .
I was to see that the doors were open and the signal of a green or white light in a window which faced the drive was to give notice if all was safe or if the attempt had better be postponed .
" But everything went wrong with us .
In some way I had excited the suspicion of Lopez , the secretary .
He crept up behind me and sprang upon me just as I had finished the note .
He and his master dragged me to my room and held judgment upon me as a convicted traitress .
Then and there they would have plunged their knives into me could they have seen how to escape the consequences of the deed .
Finally , after much debate , they concluded that my murder was too dangerous .
But they determined to get rid forever of Garcia .
They had gagged me , and Murillo twisted my arm round until I gave him the address .
I swear that he might have twisted it off had I understood what it would mean to Garcia .
Lopez addressed the note which I had written , sealed it with his sleeve-link , and sent it by the hand of the servant , Jose .
How they murdered him I do not know , save that it was Murillo 's hand who struck him down , for Lopez had remained to guard me .
I believe he must have waited among the gorse bushes through which the path winds and struck him down as he passed .
At first they were of a mind to let him enter the house and to kill him as a detected burglar ; but they argued that if they were mixed up in an inquiry their own identity would at once be publicly disclosed and they would be open to further attacks .
With the death of Garcia , the pursuit might cease , since such a death might frighten others from the task .
" All would now have been well for them had it not been for my knowledge of what they had done .
I have no doubt that there were times when my life hung in the balance .
I was confined to my room , terrorized by the most horrible threats , cruelly ill-used to break my spirit - see this stab on my shoulder and the bruises from end to end of my arms - and a gag was thrust into my mouth on the one occasion when I tried to call from the window .
For five days this cruel imprisonment continued , with hardly enough food to hold body and soul together .
This afternoon a good lunch was brought me , but the moment after I took it I knew that I had been drugged .
In a sort of dream I remember being half-led , halfcarried to the carriage ; in the same state I was conveyed to the train .
Only then , when the wheels were almost moving , did I suddenly realize that my liberty lay in my own hands .
I sprang out , they tried to drag me back , and had it not been for the help of this good man , who led me to the cab , I should never had broken away .
Now , thank God , I am beyond their power forever . "
We had all listened intently to this remarkable statement .
It was Holmes who broke the silence .
" Our difficulties are not over , " he remarked , shaking his head .
" Our police work ends , but our legal work begins . "
" Exactly , " said I .
" A plausible lawyer could make it out as an act of self-defence .
There may be a hundred crimes in the background , but it is only on this one that they can be tried . "
" Come , come , " said Baynes cheerily , " I think better of the law than that .
Self-defence is one thing .
To entice a man in cold blood with the object of murdering him is another , whatever danger you may fear from him .
No , no , we shall all be justified when we see the tenants of High Gable at the next Guildford Assizes . "
It is a matter of history , however , that a little time was still to elapse before the Tiger of San Pedro should meet with his deserts .
Wily and bold , he and his companion threw their pursuer off their track by entering a lodging-house in Edmonton Street and leaving by the back-gate into Curzon Square .
From that day they were seen no more in England .
Some six months afterwards the Marquess of Montalva and Signor Rulli , his secretary , were both murdered in their rooms at the Hotel Escurial at Madrid .
The crime was ascribed to Nihilism , and the murderers were never arrested .
Inspector Baynes visited us at Baker Street with a printed description of the dark face of the secretary , and of the masterful features , the magnetic black eyes , and the tufted brows of his master .
We could not doubt that justice , if belated , had come at last .
" A chaotic case , my dear Watson , " said Holmes over an evening pipe .
" It will not be possible for you to present in that compact form which is dear to your heart .
It covers two continents , concerns two groups of mysterious persons , and is further complicated by the highly respectable presence of our friend , Scott Eccles , whose inclusion shows me that the deceased Garcia had a scheming mind and a well-developed instinct of selfpreservation .
It is remarkable only for the fact that amid a perfect jungle of possibilities we , with our worthy collaborator , the inspector , have kept our close hold on the essentials and so been guided along the crooked and winding path .
Is there any point which is not quite clear to you ? "
" The object of the mulatto cook 's return ? "
" I think that the strange creature in the kitchen may account for it .
The man was a primitive savage from the backwoods of San Pedro , and this was his fetish .
When his companion and he had fled to some prearranged retreat - already occupied , no doubt by a confederate - the companion had persuaded him to leave so compromising an article of furniture .
But the mulatto 's heart was with it , and he was driven back to it next day , when , on reconnoitering through the window , he found policeman Walters in possession .
He waited three days longer , and then his piety or his superstition drove him to try once more .
Inspector Baynes , who , with his usual astuteness , had minimized the incident before me , had really recognized its importance and had left a trap into which the creature walked .
Any other point , Watson ? "
" The torn bird , the pail of blood , the charred bones , all the mystery of that weird kitchen ? "
Holmes smiled as he turned up an entry in his note-book .
" I spent a morning in the British Museum reading up on that and other points .
Here is a quotation from Eckermann 's Voodooism and the Negroid Religions :
" 'The true voodoo-worshipper attempts nothing of importance without certain sacrifices which are intended to propitiate his unclean gods .
In extreme cases these rites take the form of human sacrifices followed by cannibalism .
The more usual victims are a white cock , which is plucked in pieces alive , or a black goat , whose throat is cut and body burned . '
" So you see our savage friend was very orthodox in his ritual .
It is grotesque , Watson , " Holmes added , as he slowly fastened his notebook , " but , as I have had occasion to remark , there is but one step from the grotesque to the horrible . "
Introduction 
Libya has shown interest in and taken steps to acquire weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) and their delivery systems . 
Indeed , it is one of the few states to have employed chemical weapons in a conflict ( Chad , 1987 ) . 
Libya 's motivation to acquire WMD , and ballistic missiles in particular , appears in part to be a response to Israel 's clandestine nuclear program and a desire to become a more active player in Middle_Eastern and African politics . 
On 19 December 2003 , Libyan leader Col. Muammar Qadhafi publicly confirmed his commitment to disclose and dismantle WMD programs in his country following a nine-month period of negotiations with US and UK authorities . 
Nuclear 
In its 19 December 2003 announcement that it was eliminating all materials , equipment and programs proscribed by the international community , Libya took the unusual step of first publicly revealing its nuclear weapons program , then renouncing it . 
Libya then invited the IAEA to verify the elimination of nuclear weapon related activities in-country . 
According to International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Mohamed ElBaradei , who led a December 2003 inspection team to Libya , Libya 's nuclear weapons program is in the very initial stages , about three to seven years away from producing a nuclear weapon . 
Libya admitted having secretly imported raw uranium and the necessary equipment to convert it for enrichment into weapons-grade material but added that the enrichment plan had been dismantled and that no highly enriched uranium had been produced over the past decade . 
IAEA inspectors did not found either , though they did find imported equipment and technology at a number of previously secret nuclear facilities in and around Tripoli . 
It has been revealed that Abdul Qadeer Khan of Pakistan is responsible for providing Libya with its nuclear warhead plans , raw uranium and enrichment centrifuges through his black market network . 
In his 19 December 2003 announcement , Qadhafi pledged to adhere to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which Libya ratified in 1975 , and to sign the Additional Protocol , which it did on 10 March 2004 . 
IAEA chief El Baradei indicated that signing the Protocol would ensure IAEA oversight over Libya 's nuclear transition from weapons creation to peaceful purposes . 
Previously , Libya signed Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in November 2001 and ratified it in January 2004 . 
In 1996 , it had signed the Treaty of Pelindaba which established a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa . 
Besides previously secret nuclear sites disclosed in late 2003 , Libya possesses a Soviet-supplied 10 MW research reactor in Tajura . 
With the lifting of UN sanctions in 1998 , Russia renewed its nuclear cooperation with Libya , providing funding for renovations to the Taruja nuclear complex . 
Excerpts from the Nuclear and Missile Developments Database 
Biological 
In 2003 , Libya admitted its previous intentions to acquire equipment needed to produce biological weapons ( BW ) . 
In October and December 2003 , Libyan officials took US and UK experts to a number of medical and agricultural research centers that had the potential to be used in BW research . 
The country acceded to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention on 19 January 1982 . 
There are allegations that the alleged chemical weapon ( CW ) plants at Rabta and Tarhunah could contain BW research facilities as well . 
Prior to Libya 's 19 December 2003 announcement to abandon its WMD programs , US intelligence agencies alleged that Qadhafi had attempted to recruit South African scientists to assist in the acquisition of BW , and that Libya had started to develop pathogens and toxins for weapons use . 
Chemical 
There is a significant amount of open-source literature concerning Libya 's acquisition and use of chemical weapons ( CW ) ; it is well documented that Libya employed Iranian-supplied mustard gas bombs against Chad , its southern neighbor , in 1987 . 
In documentation provided to US and UK authorities in 2003 , Libya revealed a `` significant quantity '' of mustard agent produced more than 10 years ago at a facility near Rabta , located in the Sahara Desert about 120 km southwest of Tripoli , along with chemical munitions and equipment needed to establish a second CW production facility . 
In December 2003 , Libya pledged to eliminate all chemical weapons stocks and munitions and accede to the Chemical Weapons Convention `` without delay. '' 
Missile 
Libya first acquired Scud-B missiles in the early 1970 s from the Soviet Union . 
In the early 1980 s , Libya accelerated its efforts to obtain a longer-range ballistic missile with the al-Fatah , reportedly with a range of 950 km . 
Germany and China allegedly provided technical and material assistance to the al-Fatah program . 
The al-Fatah missile system has not been completed and remains untested . 
In November 2000 , as part of a $600 million agreement , Libya allegedly acquired the first shipment of a total of 50 North Korean Nodong ballistic missiles , including launch capabilities . 
North Korea also allegedly provided more than 10 scientists to work on the Libyan missile program . 
This complemented other missile component shipments that reportedly began in 1999 . 
Also , after the lifting of the 1999 sanctions , reports of increased technical and structural assistance from countries like Iran , North Korea , China , India , and Russia have raised concerns over Libya 's growing ability to manufacture ballistic missiles . 
In 2003 , US experts were given access to Libya 's missile arsenal and to a number of missile research facilities . 
In December 2003 , Libya pledged to eliminate ballistic missiles capable of traveling more than 300 km with payloads of 500 kg . 
Libya is not a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) 
Dear ,
A few months ago you received a letter from me telling the success stories of people who got jobs with Goodwill 's help .
Here 's another story of success from what might seem like an unlikely source : Goodwill 's controller , Juli .
She tells me that the 3,666 people we helped find jobs in 1998 earned approximately $ 49 million dollars .
In addition to that , by helping them find jobs , Goodwill reduced the state 's Public Support tab by an estimated $ 4 million .
Your gift to Goodwill will help us do even more this year because your gift will be used to directly support our work .
What kind of work does Goodwill do ?
Goodwill finds jobs for people with mental and physical disabilities .
After Maureen 's job coach taught her how to do her job in a restaurant , we helped Maureen step out of the shadow sometimes cast over people with physical and mental disabilities and find a fulfilling job smack dab in the middle of society .
Remember what she said in my last letter ?
`` If I was n't working here ... I would be sad ... ''
Goodwill helps people get off of public assistance .
Sherry learned through our Future Works class that she could rise out of the mire of the welfare system and support her family .
At Goodwill she gained in self - confidence , in her vision of her future and in the job skills she needed to find and keep a good job .
`` Coming to Goodwill was the first step toward my becoming totally independent .
I am now ... totally off of welfare . ''
Goodwill prepares people for life - long employment .
Cornell found a number of employment options that he never dreamed existed after a work - site injury forced him out of his job at a foundry .
He trained in desktop publishing and combined his enthusiastic work ethic with new - found skills in a burgeoning industry .
`` I 've got more than a job ; I 've got a career . ''
Goodwill provides jobs at Goodwill .
After a lifetime of trials , Donna not only earned her GED at Goodwill , she earned a job here .
`` I rode a bike to Goodwill in the rain and snow .
I wanted to be there ... I had my second chance to change my life . ''
Your gift to Goodwill will help the many people who want to tell their own stories of success .
Your support will help them go to work .
Please use the enclosed envelope to give a generous gift to Goodwill today !
Sincerely ,
William A Carter , Chairman Goodwill Industries Foundation
P.S. Your gift is a wise investment in the community .
For every dollar donated to Goodwill in 1998 , we helped our `` graduates '' earn an estimated $ 102 .
That money was then spent in a variety of ways , adding fuel to our thriving economy .

Homeland security panel drops in
`` Rhode Island is preparing itself for a major hurricane or other natural disaster , state and local officials testified at a field hearing of the Senate Homeland Security Committee Thursday , including establishing interoperable communications systems and community evacuation plans .
But , Gov . Donald Carcieri , Providence Mayor David Cicilline and others told Chairwoman Susan Collins of Maine and Rhode Island Sen . Lincoln Chafee , they need more federal money , they need it to come faster when disaster strikes and they need a steady stream they know they can rely on from year to year .
Part of the answer , Chafee said , might be giving more flexibility with the money , rather than more funds , Chafee suggested after the hearing .
The state and localities , Chafee said , sometimes get mandated to use federal homeland security funds for decontamination or preparation for bioterrorism , when the money might be better spent putting together a communications systems that would let first responders such as police , fire and rescue from different communities communicate with each other more easily.

Mock drill readies Dublin [ Georgia ] district for terrorist threat
`` More than 300 people participated Wednesday in a mock drill to deal with the aftermath of an anthrax attack .
The attack , medical personnel and volunteer `` patients '' were told , occurred at a mythical April Fool's Day parade in Dublin , said Laurice Bentley , risk communication specialist for the South Central Health District .
The attackers were environmental terrorists upset about a new industry coming to town .
The essence of the drill was to test how quickly a mass amount of medicine and treatment could be delivered to the public .
' I think , overall , things went very well , ' said Lawton Davis , head of the South Central Health District .
' There was excellent participation and cooperation .
' Though about 350 people participated in the drill , about 500 patients were actually processed because many participants went through multiple times , with varying symptoms each time .
Jennifer McLeod , a registered nurse and instructor at HGTC , acted as a patient in the drill .
Having worked as a nurse , she decided to throw the personnel a few curves .
She told them she was 12 weeks pregnant , had HIV and was hemorrhaging .

New evidence that Canadian trash is a security threat
`` Every day , about 350 trucks carrying trash from Canada come into Michigan to dump it in our landfills .
The U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection has no effective way to screen or inspect these trash trucks as they enter Michigan , and the potential consequences of this security gap are immense .
The Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) recently completed a study , conducted in response to a request I [ Carl Levin ] made with Senator Debbie Stabenow and Rep . John Dingell that bluntly acknowledges the security risk these trucks pose .
The DHS report describes the three methods currently used by customs officials to inspect the trucks : a Radiation Portal Monitor to detect the presence of radiation , a Vehicle and Cargo Inspection System screening that creates an image similar to an X-ray , and physical inspections .
The screening methods are nearly useless for screening trash , however , due to the density and lack of uniform content of trash shipments .
The X-ray image produced is nothing more than a large amorphous black mass. I fear that for every trash truck caught carrying contraband into Michigan , many more get through undetected with drugs , medical waste or other illegal material .
Ignoring the possibility that these trucks could be used by terrorists to transport biological or chemical weapons is irresponsible .
It is now unequivocally clear that these trash shipments are a weak link in our security. '' ( hometownlife.com ; 19Apr06 ; Carl Levin , U.S. Senator from Michigan ) ( Link )
A Brief History
Jerusalem 's recorded history begins with its mention in Egyptian court records 4,000 years ago , but there had been human settlements here for centuries , probably millennia , before that .
At the beginning of the second millennium b.c. , Jerusalem was a Canaanite mountain stronghold on a secondary trade route , far less important than biblical cities such as Hazor , Megiddo , Beth Shean , and Shechem .
The earliest name associated with the city , Ur usalim , perhaps meant `` city of Shalim '' or `` founded by Shalim . ''
Scholars speculate that Shalim might have been an ancient Semitic deity of peace , for the name resembles the modern Hebrew and Arabic words for `` peace '' : shalom and salaam , respectively .
If true , this is an ironic name for a city that would become one of the most constantly and bitterly embattled places on the face of the earth .
Biblical Jerusalem
In the Bible , Genesis 14:18 - 20 records that Abraham visited the city of `` Salem '' in approximately 1800 b.c. and was blessed by the city 's ruler , Melchzedik , who offered him bread and wine .
The city is not mentioned again in the Bible until the time of the great poet warrior , King David , who captured the city from the Jebusites in about 1000 b.c. .
The Bible describes how David 's soldiers conquered Jerusalem by discovering a water tunnel under the walls and using it to take the city by surprise .
Warren 's Shaft , part of a Canaanite water system discovered by 19th - century archaeologists and open to visitors , might be the very tunnel infiltrated by David 's army .
Perhaps because Jerusalem was in neutral territory not allotted to any of the twelve rival tribes of Israel , David made it the capital of his newly formed kingdom and brought the most talented artisans , dedicated priests , magical poets and musicians , and the most formidable soldiers from each of the tribes to live in his city .
He also brought the Ark of the Covenant , the portable tabernacle containing the Tablets of the Law received on Mount Sinai , to the Spring of Gihon , just outside the walls of Jerusalem .
There the Ark rested until it was placed in the Temple , built in approximately 960 b.c. on Mt. Moriah , the high point at the northern end of the city .
The Temple ( today known as the `` First '' Temple ) was completed by David 's son and successor , King Solomon .
According to biblical tradition , although David bought the land for the Temple and carefully assembled its building materials , he was deemed unworthy of constructing the Temple because he was a man of war with blood on his hands .
At the Temple 's dedication , Solomon addressed his God : `` ... the Heavens , even the Heaven of the Heavens , can not contain Thee ; how much less this House that I have built ? ''
The site of the Temple eventually became identified as Mt. Moriah , on which it stood , where Abraham was called to sacrifice his son Isaac .
Along with this splendid house of worship , Solomon built a royal palace , mansions for his wives , temples for the foreign gods worshipped by the princesses he had married , and towers for the defense of the capital .
Under the wise reign of Solomon , the city flourished as the capital of an empire that stretched from Damascus to the Red Sea and controlled the trade routes from Egypt to Phoenicia .
The Temple and royal palace were adorned with gold and ivory from Africa and with cedar from Lebanon ; the beauties and glories of Jerusalem under Solomon have captivated readers of the Bible for almost 3,000 years .
But with his death the empire collapsed , and the Israelite kingdom was divided into two separate , impoverished , often warring nations : Israel , with its capital at Shechem in the north , ruled by a series of northern dynasties ; and the smaller kingdom of Judah , with its capital at Jerusalem , from which the Davidic dynasty continued to rule .
The Bible tells us that the cruelty and impiety of the rulers of both kingdoms aroused the fury of the great Prophets .
In 701 b.c. the Assyrian armies of Sennacherib destroyed Israel and moved southward to besiege Jerusalem .
Thanks to King Hezekiah 's hidden water tunnel , the city narrowly escaped destruction .
The end of David 's dynasty came in 587 b.c. , when Nebuchadnezzar , King of Babylon , invaded Judah to lay siege to Jerusalem .
When it fell , the Temple and all the buildings were burned .
The people of the once - glorious city were forced into an exile known as `` the Babylonian Captivity . ''
In time , the kingdom of Babylon was overthrown and the Israelites were permitted to return to Jerusalem in 539 b.c. The city was now under the more tolerant rule of the Persians , but rebuilding was slow work .
The Second Temple was finished in 515 b.c. , but much of the city still lay in ruins .
Jerusalem submitted peaceably to the rule of the Greeks in 332 b.c. under Alexander the Great and , subsequently , to his Hellenistic successors as well as the Egyptian Ptolomeys and the Syrian Seleucids .
When Seleucid rulers outlawed Judaism , Jews led by Judah Maccabee and his brothers staged a revolution in 167 b.c. and , against all odds , restored the primacy of Jewish religious life in Jerusalem .
The Macabbees cleansed the Temple of Hellenistic idols and the blood of pagan sacrifices ; the eight - day celebration of Hanukkah ( Feast of Dedication ) commemorates their victory .
The Hasmonean dynasty , descendants of the Maccabee family , ruled an independent Jewish Commonwealth that stretched from the Negev to the Galilee .
Jerusalem grew , surrounded with a formidable wall and defended by towers beside the Jaffa Gate .
The Hasmoneans ruled until Pompey 's Roman legions arrived in 63 b.c.
Roman Jerusalem
After the initial years of Roman administration and political infighting , Rome installed Herod ( scion of a family from Idumea , a Jewish kingdom in the desert ) as King of Judea .
He reigned from 37 to 4 b.c. , during which time he fortified the Hasmonean wall and rebuilt the defense towers beside Jaffa Gate , the foundation of which still stand .
Several palaces were built and a water system installed .
Herod also completely rebuilt the Temple , making it one of the most important religious centers in the Roman Empire .
The courtyard around the Temple was expanded to accommodate hundreds of thousands of pilgrims , and the Temple Mount was shored up by retaining walls made with great stone blocks .
One of these walls , the Western Wall , is today a major reminder of Jerusalem 's greatness under Herod .
A massive fortress was built overlooking the Temple Mount , which Herod named `` Antonia '' in honor of his Roman friend and benefactor , Mark Antony .
For all his accomplishments , Herod was nevertheless hated by his subjects ; he taxed , he tortured , and he ordered the massacre of male Jewish infants in an attempt to do away with the heralded Messiah .
When Jesus was born in about 4 b.c. , Joseph and Mary escaped Herod 's paranoia by fleeing into Egypt with the new - born infant .
They returned to live in the Galilee village of Nazareth , making pilgrimages to Jerusalem .
According to biblical accounts , Jesus spent his life ministering in the Galilee Valley .
In about a.d. 30 he and his followers went for Passover to Jerusalem , which was in unrest at this time , dissatisfied with Roman domination .
Jesus 's entry into the Temple caused a commotion ; after the Passover dinner he was arrested by the temple priests , who were under direct Roman rule .
Jesus was put on trial quickly and condemned to crucifixion , a Roman form of execution for political and religious dissidents as well as for common criminals .
In a province rife with rebellion and retaliation , the execution in Jerusalem of yet another religious leader from the Galilee did not by itself have an immediate effect on history .
After Jesus 's crucifixion , harsh Roman rule continued until a.d. 66 , when the Jews rebelled .
For four years Jewish zealots fought against the might of Rome .
At the end , the Roman general Titus laid siege to Jerusalem in a.d. 70 , finally attacking its starved and weakened defenders .
Those who did n't escape were executed or sold into slavery .
The Holy City and the Temple were destroyed .
The last of the zealots held out for another three years at Masada ( see page 76 ) .
Half a million civilians died in the Galilee and Judea as a result of this first revolt against Rome , a number unequaled in ancient warfare .
Christian and Islamic Jerusalem
For 60 years Jerusalem lay in ruins , until the Roman Emperor Hadrian ordered the city rebuilt as a Roman town dedicated to Jupiter .
In outrage , the Jews began a second revolt against Rome , led by Simon bar Kochba .
The ruins of Jerusalem were briefly liberated , but , in the end , Jewish resistance to Rome was defeated with great loss of life .
The planned new Roman city , Aelia Capitolina , was built over the ruins of Herodian Jerusalem , and Jews were barred from residing there for all time .
Jerusalem 's physical existence as a spiritual city seemed finished , but its spiritual power for Jews , and for the struggling new Christian religion , remained .
For the next two centuries Aelia Capitolina enjoyed an innocuous history .
But the Roman Empire became Christian in the fourth century , and Jerusalem became a center of religion once again .
Queen Helena , a devout Christian and the mother of Emperor Constantine the Great , made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 326 to identify the sites associated with Jesus 's life .
She found that the city 's most beautiful Roman temple , dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite , stood on the site of the crucifixion .
The temple was demolished and a vast , Classical - style church was built around Golgotha ( the hill where Jesus 's crucifixion was believed to have taken place ) .
Throughout Jerusalem , other spots important to Jesus 's life were commemorated with religious structures .
Pilgrims came from all over the Roman ( and , later , Byzantine ) Empire during the following centuries , but the prosperity they brought lasted only until 614 , when Persian armies overtook Judea and reduced Jerusalem to rubble again .
In 629 , Jerusalem was recaptured by the Byzantines .
Still reeling from the effects of the Persian devastation , Jerusalem was conquered in 638 by the forces of Islam .
The Temple Mount was identified in Islamic tradition as `` the farthest spot '' ( in Arabic , el-aksa ) , the site to which the Prophet Muhammad was transported in one night from Mecca on a winged horse , as described in the 17th chapter of the Koran .
From here the Prophet ascended to the heavens and was permitted to glimpse paradise .
The rock on the Temple Mount from which he ascended , at or close to the site of the ruined Temple , was commemorated by the construction of the Dome of the Rock in 691 .
The Dome of the Rock remains Jerusalem 's most striking monument ; it is counted among the most beautiful buildings ever created .
By about 715 , the El-Aksa Mosque , third holiest place of prayer in Islam ( after Mecca and Medina ) , had been built on the southern side of the Temple Mount .
Jerusalem continued under Islamic rule for the next four and a half centuries .
In 1099 , under their leaders Godfrey de Bouillon and Tancred , the Crusaders captured the Holy City for Christendom by slaughtering both Muslims and Jews .
Crusaders , Mamelukes , and Turks
The Crusaders established a feudal Christian state with Godfrey at its head .
They built many impressive churches during the term of the first Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem , but in 1187 they were driven out by Muslim forces under the great warrior Saladin .
During the Sixth Crusade ( 1228 - 1229 ) , the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II managed to secure Jerusalem for the Christians by negotiation .
The Christians , however , could not hold the city .
After they lost Jerusalem , a Mongol invasion swept through , and in 1244 the Mameluke dynasty of Egypt took control , ruling Jerusalem for the next 250 years .
The city struggled to rebuild from Crusader wars and invasions .
Much of the best Islamic architecture in the city was constructed in the Mameluke era , but the past thousand years had taken their toll : Jerusalem was unable to regain the prosperity it had enjoyed in earlier times .
In the early 16th century , the Ottoman Turkish Empire was advancing through the Middle East .
Jerusalem fell to the Ottomans in 1517 , remaining under their control for 400 years .
Suleiman the Magnificent rebuilt the walls and gates in the form they retain to this day .
Fountains , inns , religious schools , and barracks were constructed .
But when Suleiman died , his empire , including Jerusalem , began a long period of decline .
The Holy City remained a backwater until the 19th century , when renewed interest among Christian pilgrims made it the destination of thousands of travelers each year .
19th - Century Aspirations
At the same time , many Jews sought religious freedom and fulfillment by moving to Palestine ( as the Holy Land was traditionally called ) and especially to Jerusalem .
In the 1890s , Theodor Herzl ( 1860 - 1904 ) worked to organize a movement , Zionism , to create a Jewish state .
Chaim Weizmann ( 1874 - 1952 ) , a scientist born in Russia but later a British subject , did much to put Herzl 's hopes into practice .
Weizmann was an important figure in the negotiations with the British government that led to the Balfour Declaration of 1917 , supporting the idea of a Jewish `` national home '' in Palestine that also respected the rights of existing non - Jewish people already living there .
The problem was that British strategists , who were fighting the Ottoman Turks in 1917 , had secretly promised the lands to their World War I Arab allies .
In 1922 the League of Nations granted the British a mandate to administer Palestine .
Jerusalem flourished during the early years of the Mandate .
Modern neighborhoods , hospitals , schools , and the Hebrew University were built in West Jerusalem , the new Jewish enclave .
But Arab opposition to new Jewish immigration and construction in Palestine led to increasing strife ; by 1946 , Jerusalem was an armed camp .
In 1947 the United Nations voted for the partition of Palestine into two states , one Jewish and one Arab , with Jerusalem as an international city that belonged to neither .
But lacking the means to enforce its decision , the United Nations was powerless to halt the fighting that erupted as the British withdrew their troops in 1948 .
Modern Israel
The State of Israel was declared during this difficult time .
In response , member states of the Arab League sent troops to help the Palestinian Arabs .
West Jerusalem , separated from the rest of the new Jewish nation , held out under siege for several months until Israeli forces secured a land corridor connecting the city to the coastal areas .
Jews were evacuated from the Old City 's Jewish Quarter , and thousands of Arab families fled their homes in West Jerusalem .
As a result of armistice agreements in 1949 , Jerusalem was divided : West Jerusalem was to be under Israeli control , and East Jerusalem ( including the Old City , with its Jewish , Muslim , Christian , and Armenian quarters ) came under Jordanian authority .
Free access to holy sites for members of all religions was guaranteed by the armistice agreements .
However , with the city partitioned by fortifications and barbed wire , no Israeli or Jewish pilgrims were allowed to visit the Western Wall or other Jewish sites in East Jerusalem .
For the next 19 years , Jerusalem was two cities .
Political and religious boundaries were aggravated by occasional incidents of terrorism or sniping until the Six Day War in June 1967 .
Within three days the city was completely in Israeli hands , and in two weeks it was physically and administratively reunited .
Jerusalem 's mayor , Teddy Kollek , spent the next 25 years orchestrating a vast program of development , adding new cultural institutions and parks and instituting neighborhood restoration projects while tirelessly mediating the concerns of Jerusalem 's many communities .
Today , as always , Jerusalem is a city of controversies : religious Jews in conflict with secular Jews ; Palestinians calling for independence ; many residents protesting a wave of high - rise development that many claim will turn the Holy City into a holy megalopolis .
But the ideas and mystique that have always made this an extraordinarily special place rise above the ebbing and flowing concerns of present - day Jerusalem as it continues to tug at the world 's attention into the new millennium .

Lawmaker Appeals for Innocent Iraqis
By HASSAN ABDULWAHAB , Associated Press Writer
BASRA , Iraq ( AP ) A U.S. lawmaker assessing the impact of U.N. sanctions on Iraq said Wednesday it is important not only to force Baghdad to give up its weapons of mass destruction but also to do more to ease the hardships on ordinary Iraqis .
Rep . Tony Hall , D- Ohio , did not call for a lifting of sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait , but said the United Nations should make sure that sanctions do not hurt innocent Iraqis .
`` It was very , very important '' to compel Iraq to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction so that `` it can not use or export them to other countries , '' he told Associated Press Television News .
But he insisted the international community can do a much better job in helping Iraq deal with its economic and health problems .
One way would be to speed up the flow of health supplies and other urgent commodities to the country under a U.N. humanitarian program , he said .
Iraq says the United States and Britain hold up delivery of needed supplies , using their clout in the United Nations .
The U.S. government says it wants to ensure that Iraq is not buying items that appear to be humanitarian in nature but that could be used for making weapons .
It can be hoped that Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez will draw the right conclusion from his narrow election victory Sunday .
A strong challenge from the far left , the Communist coalition Izquierda Unida , failed to topple him .
He should consider his victory a mandate to continue his growth-oriented economic reforms and not a demand that he move further left .
If he follows the correct path , he may be able to look back on this election as the high-water mark of far-left opposition .
The far left had some good issues even if it did not have good programs for dealing with them .
It could point to plenty of ailments that the Spanish economic rejuvenation so far has failed to cure .
Unemployment still is officially recorded at 16.5 % , the highest rate in Europe , although actual joblessness may be lower .
Housing is scarce and public services -- the court system , schools , mail service , telephone network and the highways -- are in disgraceful condition .
Large pockets of poverty still exist .
The left also is critical of the style of the Socialist government -- a remarkable parallel to the situation in Britain .
Mr. Gonzalez and his colleagues , particularly the finance minister , Carlos Solchaga , are charged with having abandoned their socialist principles and with having become arrogant elitists who refuse even to go on television ( controlled by the state ) to face their accusers .
In response to this , the Socialist prime minister has simply cited his free-market accomplishments .
They are very considerable : Since 1986 , when Spain joined the European Community , its gross domestic product has grown at an annual average of 4.6 % -- the fastest in the EC .
In that time more than 1.2 million jobs have been created and the official jobless rate has been pushed below 17 % from 21 % .
A 14 % inflation rate dropped below 5 % .
Net foreign investment through August this year has been running at a pace of $ 12.5 billion , about double the year-earlier rate .
Mr. Gonzalez also has split with the left in reaffirming Spain 's NATO commitment and in renewing a defense treaty with the U.S .
Mr. Gonzalez is not quite a closet supply-side revolutionary , however .
He did not go as far as he could have in tax reductions ; indeed he combined them with increases in indirect taxes .
Yet the best the far-left could do was not enough to deter the biggest voting bloc -- nearly 40 % -- from endorsing the direction Spain is taking .
Now he can go further .
He should do more to reduce tax rates on wealth and income , in recognition of the fact that those cuts yield higher , not lower , revenues .
He could do more to cut public subsidies and transfers , thus making funds available for public services starved of money for six years .
The voters delivered Mr. Gonzalez a third mandate for his successes .
They , as well as numerous Latin American and East European countries that hope to adopt elements of the Spanish model , are supporting the direction Spain is taking .
It would be sad for Mr. Gonzalez to abandon them to appease his foes .
Introduction
Over the past 25 years , the Islamic Republic of Iran has pursued an aggressive ballistic missile and long - range artillery rocket development program .
Since the late 1980s , this program has been assigned a national priority at least equal to that of the nuclear program .
Although Iran 's economy is not flourishing , unemployment is high and there is a low level of internal unrest concerning the restrictive nature of the Islamic government , ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) development continue to receive very high commitments of financial and material resources -- and will likely do so for the foreseeable future .
The development of ballistic missiles and long - range artillery rockets within Iran has proceeded in a relatively steady , logical , and predictable manner .
Today , it possesses the second largest ( behind the Democratic People's Republic of Korea -- DPRK ) ballistic missile force in the third world and is near to developing a space launch vehicle and medium - range and intercontinental ballistic missiles that could threaten Europe and the continental United States .
This is an ominous development since there is little doubt that Iran perceives the ballistic missile to be the delivery system of choice for nuclear weapons .
Iran currently possesses the capability to employ ballistic missiles and/or long - range artillery rockets against its regional neighbors , Israel , and US forces deployed in the region .
Given favorable conditions , Iran is currently on track to be able to extend its ballistic missile capabilities to include Southern Europe , North Africa , and South Asia by 2005 - 2010 and possibly the continental United States by 2015 .
These estimates could be somewhat accelerated or easily delayed dependent upon a host of international and domestic factors that can not be accurately predicted .
A large number of Iran 's ballistic missiles and / or long - range artillery rocket systems currently possess the capability to deliver conventional high explosive , submunition , chemical , biological and radiological dispersion warheads .
Given a favorable set of circumstances , Iran could achieve a true nuclear weapons delivery capability within the next five years .
History
The development of ballistic missiles and long - range artillery rockets within Iran can be divided into three broad chronological stages : Pre - revolution ( 1977 - 1979 ) ; Post - revolution and the war with Iraq ( 1980 - 1988 ) ; and Post War ( 1989 - Present ) .
The latter two stages may themselves be subdivided into distinct phases .
This development has been strongly influenced by a number of interrelated factors , all of which have varied considerably in importance over time .
These include , but are not limited to : Necessities of war and the short distance to Iraqi strategic targets .
Quantity and quality of missiles and missile - related technology acquired , size and experience of the indigenous missile - related manpower pool .
Capabilities of the Iranian military - industrial infrastructure .
Desire to possess the capability to strike directly at Israel and US military facilities within South Asia .
Organizational , political , and religious discord amongst the various entities engaged in the design , development , and production of ballistic missiles .
Early Developments Under the Shah Pahlavi ( 1977 - 1979 )
The origins of the Iranian missile program date back to the late 1970s and the last years that the Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi ruled Iran .
In July 1977 , Iranian Vice Minister of War General H. Toufanian traveled to Israel and met with Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and Minister of Defense Ezer Weizmann .
Among a number of joint Israeli - Iranian military projects discussed at these meetings was `` Project Flower . ''
This project was focused on the development of a longer ranged ( 150 - 200 km ) and more heavily armed version of the Israeli Gabriel anti - ship missile ( not as sometimes reported with the development of a ballistic missile based upon Israeli Jericho surface - to - surface missile technology ) .
It is possible , however , that this subject was discussed , since General Toufanian apparently attended a test - launch of a Jericho missile .
Also discussed at these meetings was an Iranian interest in extending Project Flower to include a future submarine launched variant and Iranian concerns over missile and nuclear developments in India and Pakistan .
The following year , Iran made a down payment for Project Flower by providing Israel with $280 million worth of oil .
To support this project , a team of Iranian experts began construction of a missile assembly facility near Sirjan , in south central Iran , and a missile test range near Rafsanjan .
During February 1979 , the Imperial Iranian regime of the Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi collapsed , and along with it died Project Flower .
Islamic Revolution and the War With Iraq ( 1980 - 1988 )
At the time of the Islamic fundamentalist revolution in 1979 , Iran had no long - range artillery rocket or ballistic missile capabilities to speak of .
This situation remained essentially unchanged through the following year when Iraq launched its invasion .
The continued Iraqi use of FROG-7A artillery rockets against Iranian cities led to Iran 's interest in long - range artillery rockets and ballistic missiles .
Thus began a see-saw race with Iraq for superiority in these weapons .
This race would last throughout the eight - year - long war .
It would bring about the development of an indigenous Iranian missile industry , two `` wars of the cities , '' and the evolution of a strategic concept concerning the military and political importance of ballistic missiles .
Iran , however , lost both the ballistic missile race and arguably the war , which only served to reinforce its desire to possess and produce ballistic missiles .
In 1982 , as the war dragged on into its second year , Iraqi operations entered a new phase in which it expanded the use of FROG-7As strikes and the first employment ( three attacks in 1982 ) of the Scud-B short - range ballistic missile ( SRBM ) to strike at the Iranian strategic rear .
The casualties caused by these attacks and the Iranian inability to respond in kind resulted in an effort to acquire long - range artillery rockets and ballistic missiles -- especially the Scud-B . Iran also established several indigenous ballistic missile and rocket programs .
The acquisition effort was thwarted from its inception by a number of significant factors .
The Soviet Union was then supplying Iraq with the Scud-B and those countries to which the Soviets had previously sold Scud-Bs were under contract not to transfer them to third parties .
Of the nations with whom Iran had relations , only two were likely to run the risk reselling their Scud-Bs : Libya and Syria .
Negotiations with both countries are believed to have begun during early 1983 .
Sometime during 1984 , Iran successfully concluded a secret agreement with Libya for the purchase of a small number of MAZ-543P transporter - erector launchers ( TELs ) and Scud-B missiles .
The details of the early Iranian ballistic missile and rocket programs , as well as their immediate objectives , are presently unknown .
By the end of 1982 , there appears to have been four major components -- indigenous design and production of crude artillery rockets , the indigenous design and production of a artillery rocket comparable to the FROG-7A , the acquisition of Scud-B missiles , and the reverse engineering and production of the Scud-B. The greatest obstacle to developing any indigenous capabilities was the status of the Ministry of Defense 's Defense Industries Organization ( DIO ) , and later Islamic Revolution Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Construction Jihad , industrial infrastructure .
As these components developed over the years , they would actually consist of a series of concurrent programs pursued semi - independently by the Air Force , DIO , and the IRGC Construction Jihad .
This often resulted in unnecessary competition , the dilution of effort , and abortive programs .
It was during this period that Iran also approached both the DPRK and People's Republic of China ( PRC ) seeking missile technology and tactical ballistic missiles in the Scud-B class .
At that time , neither country possessed a system of the type requested by Iran .
The DPRK , however , had acquired small numbers of Scud-Bs ( i.e. , R-17Es ) from Egypt and was pursuing a multifaceted missile research and development program .
The goal was to produce both reverse - engineered and extended - range variants of the R-17E known as the Hwasong-5 and the Hwasong-6 , respectively .
As a result of the 1984 agreement with Libya , approximately two MAZ-543P TELs and 20 Scud-B missiles are believed to have reached Iran during January or February 1985 .
Upon arrival , the missiles were assigned to a newly created battalion - sized missile unit of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Air Force , whose personnel had received preliminary training in both Libya and Syria .
In approximately one month , the missile unit attained initial operational capability .
On 12 March 1985 , Iran conducted its first ballistic missile attack against Iraq , when at 0240 hours , troops launched a Libyan supplied Scud-B at Kirkuk .
This was followed two days later by an early morning attack on the Iraqi capital of Baghdad .
By 1 April , a total of eight Scud-Bs had been fired .
The Iranians identified the unit that conducted these attacks as the Khatam ol-Anbya ( a.k.a. , Khatam- ul-Anbia , `` Seal of the Prophets '' ) missile unit .
During the next three months , both sides conducted a small - scale `` War of the Cities , '' with Iran launching missiles at Baghdad and Iraq countering with Scud-B missile attacks upon number of Iranian border cities .
As a result of a cease-fire agreement in early June , the first `` War of the Cities '' came to an end and neither side is reported to have launched any missiles for the remainder of the year .
Two weeks after the cease-fire , Hashemi-Rafsanjani led a high - level delegation to the PRC and DPRK .
In both countries , Hashemi - Rafsanjani secured increased military assistance and agreements to sell Iranian missiles and engage in bilateral missile technology exchanges .
Specifically , during the visit to the PRC , he secured a PRC agreement in the following missile - related areas : The delivery of HY-1 silkworm and HY-2 seersucker coastal defense missiles beginning in 1986 and assistance in establishing an assembly facility for these missiles .
The continued delivery of HN-5A and HQ-1/2 SAMs .
Technology transfer and long - term assistance in the development of Iranian ballistic missiles and artillery rockets .
The visit to the DPRK was equally fruitful , and he secured DPRK assistance in the following missile - related areas : The delivery of HN-5A SAMs and assistance in establishing an assembly facility for these and the HQ-1/2 SAMs .
Long - term assistance in the establishment of a factories to manufacture the HN-5A and HQ-2 .
Technology transfer for new Iranian missiles and artillery rockets .
Assistance in the establishment of a factory to assemble the DPRK Scud variant missiles .
Beginning in June 1986 , Iran initiated isolated Scud-B attacks against Baghdad and Kirkuk .
By the end of 1986 , Iran had launched an additional eight missiles , bringing its total of Scud- Bs fired against Iraq to approximately 22 .
Sometime in June 1987 , Iran concluded a follow-on arms agreement worth an estimated $500 million with the DPRK .
The agreement called for the supply of Hwasong-5 missiles , TELs , and HY-1 silkworm coastal defense missiles , and assistance in establishing first an assembly and then production capability for the Hwasong-5 in Iran .
The exact details of the agreement are unknown ; however , it is estimated to have consisted of approximately 90 - 100 missiles and an estimated six TELs .
Within Iran , the Hwasong-5 was designated the Shehab-1 ( `` meteor '' or `` shooting star '' ) .
Upon arrival the missiles were assigned to the Missile Unit of the IRGC Air Force , which appears to have been expanded to brigade size and been responsible for all Scud operations against Iraq .
In 1987 , the Missile Unit of the IRGC Air Force fired 18 Shehab-1 missiles , increasing to 40 the total number launched against Iraq to date .
This probably depleted their inventory of missiles obtained from Libya and Syria .
Progress within the Shehab-1 program was relatively steady and during early 1988 , Iranian officials claimed that the missile had entered production .
In 1988 , Colonel Rahimi , First Deputy Minister of Defense , stated `` ... We have also succeeded in manufacturing missiles with a range of 320km . ''
This 320km range is the range of the Shehab-1 ( i.e. , Hwasong-5 ) and is slightly greater than the 280km of the standard Scud-B. It is unlikely that the Iranians manufactured these missiles , but rather they were assembled from components provided by the DPRK .
It appears that it would n't be until the early 1990s that Iran would advance from assembly to production of the Shehab-1 .
In the early morning hours of 29 February 1988 , Iran -- in its largest missile attack of the war to date -- launched three Shehab-1s against Baghdad .
This attack was in response to a major air attack on an oil refinery in Tehran two days earlier .
Iraq quickly responded that afternoon , launching five of its new long - range al-Husayn missiles against Tehran .
Thus began the second `` War of the Cities . ''
Iran 's ability to conduct these attacks was primarily the result of two factors .
First , was the experience gained in missile operations during the previous three years , especially by the Missile Unit of the IRGC Air Force .
Second , it had enlarged its Shehab-1 , Oghab ( a 40km artillery rocket ) , and Shahin II ( a large caliber 20km artillery rocket ) inventory during 1987 .
By 1 April , the Iranian total had reached 258 ; however , only 61 were Shehab-1s , in comparison to 129 Iraqi al-Husayn missiles .
From this point on , the number of Shehab-1 and Oghab launches quickly declined as Iran depleted its inventory .
For a variety of reasons , Iraq -- feeling victorious -- declared a unilateral cease-fire on 21 April 1988 .
The Iranians tacitly agreed and the War of the Cities was over .
During the 52 days of the War of the Cities , approximately 532 rockets and missiles had been launched by both sides .
Iran launched approximately 339 ( 80 Shehab-1s , 253 Oghabs , and 6 Shahin-IIs ) and Iraq launched about 193 ( 189 al-Husayns and 4 Scud-Bs ) .
Within four months of the end of the second War of the Cities , and following a continuing string of Iraqi victories ( most notably on the Fao Peninsula ) , Iran sued for peace .
On 8 August 1988 , after eight years of bitter fighting and tens of thousands of casualties , the Iran - Iraq war came to a formal end .
Iran had not only been defeated on the battlefield , it had , more significantly , been defeated at home .
Its economy was depleted , its civilian industry near collapse , and its population was simply exhausted from the war .
Post War Expansion ( 1988 - Present )
Building upon the foundations established during the war , Iran 's missile and long - range artillery rocket programs were reorganized during the late 1980s and have developed along two broad paths -- solid - fueled and liquid - fueled systems .
The solid - fuel component built upon the foundation laid with the Oghab and Shahin-II programs and would lead to the Fajr , Nazeat , and Zelzal families of long - range artillery rockets .
This effort has relied heavily upon PRC assistance .
Sometime during 1988 , it is believed that the PRC agreed to assist Iran modernize and expand its facilities at Parchin and Semnan to enable the design and manufacture of solid fuel artillery rockets and missiles of indigenous design .
Initially it was believed that these facilities would eventually assemble and then produce the M-9/DF-15 and M-11/DF-11 .
As part of this effort , agreements were reportedly concluded between Iran and the PRC during 1991, 1992 , and 1993 to provide Iran with technology , components , and complete M-9/11 missiles .
Available information suggests that , with the exception of possibly one - two prototypes , the PRC has not delivered complete M-9/11 missiles to Iran .
PRC - US agreements have apparently been the primary reason for the missiles not being delivered .
As a result of these agreements , the PRC refocused its efforts on assisting Iran with its indigenous short - range solid fuel systems .
This assistance has included the sale of production and missile component technologies , training of personnel , construction of the Shahrud Missile Test Facility , and the assembly and production of the M-7 ( a.k.a. , CSS-8 , 8610 or B610 ) .
During the war , Iran 's liquid fuel program had initially focused upon the production of a reverse - engineered Scud-Bs .
This effort quickly floundered for a variety of reasons and was refocused on the assembly and maintenance of the DPRK produced Scud-B/Hwasong-5 -- known locally as the Shehab-1 .
This program would subsequently lead into the Shehab-2 ( Scud-C/Hwasong-6 ) and Shehab-3 ( Nodong ) programs .
These programs rely heavily upon DPRK and Russian technology and assistance .
Although since the late 1990s , DPRK technology and assistance have been declining as Russian has been increasing .
More advance liquid fuel programs include the Shehab-4 and Shehab-5 .
These programs are believed to rely heavily upon the assistance from numerous Russian and Eastern European entities .
During mid - 2001 , Iran is reported to have initiated a comprehensive review and reorganization of its diverse rocket and missile development programs .
This effort is believed to have been initiated in an effort to prioritize and rationalize the entire development and production infrastructure and reduce costs .
How this will affect the various programs is presently unclear .
There are conflicting indications as to the level of coordination and integration of DPRK and PRC assistance within Iran .
Some sources suggest that it is very close .
Other sources suggest that while Iran is receiving assistance from both the PRC and DPRK with their missile programs , the two countries are working independently , but in coordination .
While the level of assistance provided by Russian entities since the early 1990s is significant , it is presently unclear as to the level of cooperation and coordination among the various Russian , PRC , and DPRK entities within Iran .
Iran 's post - war missile programs have also benefited at times from bilateral cooperation with Pakistan and the acquisition of production hardware , non - restricted components , and restricted components from the former Soviet Union ( e.g. , Belarus , Ukraine , Kazakhstan , and Uzbekistan ) and European countries .
In addition , Iran has made a concerted effort to lure back scientists and technical experts who fled the country at the time of the Islamic revolution .
These personnel have the potential to bring back a tremendous wealth of technical expertise and experience .
By 2000 , Iran 's ballistic missile effort would become the `` ... the largest in the Middle East ... '' and would rival that of the DPRK in size and scope .
As of late 2003 , Iran possesses the second largest ballistic missile force in the third world ( behind that of the DPRK ) and is on the verge of developing a space launch vehicle and intercontinental ballistic missiles .
Since the start of 2004 till the present , Iran has proved that it will not give up on developing its nascent missile production programs .
In early 2004 , Iran announced the inauguration of a new liquid - fuel Ra 'ad missile , and initiated production facilities for the short - range , image - guided Kosar missile .
The United States has cited numerous cases of Iran receiving assistance in its missile production from countries such as North Korea and Russia , and has even placed sanctions on private companies for aiding Iran .
Iranian Defense and Foreign Ministry officials continue to defend Iran 's right to protect itself from potential threats in the region , while denying any ill intent towards countries such as the United States .
As of early September 2004 , Iran was cited as testing its Shehab-3 missile for a second time , further proving its persistence to test and develop its extended range missile capabilities .
US officials ' growing concerns about Iran 's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction capabilities were heightened by the latest test of the Shehab-3 on October 20 .
This test occurred just days before a meeting was to take place between Iran and European officials to discuss Iran 's nuclear program .
The test appeared to be Iran 's message to the international community that it can not and will not be bullied .
Capabilities
Overview
Iran currently possesses the capability to employ ballistic missiles and/or long - range artillery rockets against its regional neighbors , Israel and US forces deployed in the region .
A large number of these systems currently possess the capability to delivery chemical , biological or radiological dispersion warheads .
If conditions remain favorable , it will be able to extend the reach of its ballistic missile forces to include Southern Europe , North Africa , and South Asia by 2005 - 2010 and possibly the continental United States by 2015 .
A true nuclear weapons delivery capability could be obtained within the next five years .
Any one of a host of international or domestic factors , however , could accelerate or delay these developments .
Iran believes that a strong missile force is critical to its security and acts as a deterrent to foreign ( especially US ) aggression .
This concept was clearly articulated by Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani on 7 February 1999 when he stated , `` Iraq would have undoubtedly not attacked us 20 years ago if we he had then the power we have now ... .Because of our deterrent power , Israel 's threatening rhetoric against us has also decreased lately . ''
Available information suggests that Iran has a current ballistic missile inventory of 325 - 550 systems : 200 - 300 Shehab-1 , 100 - 150 Shehab-2 , 25 - 100 Shehab-3 , and 1 - 5 Shehab-4/5 prototypes .
The relative numbers of Shehab-1 and Shehab-2 systems could change in favor of the Shehab-2 if Iran undertakes to upgrade the earlier systems to Shehab-2 configuration .
Reliable estimates of long - range artillery rocket ( e.g. , Fajr , Nazeat and Zelzal ) inventories are unavailable .
These totals could quickly be increased should Iran make the decision to either purchase additional systems from the DPRK or accelerate Shehab-3 production .
Although information is sparse , Iran is believed to field the equivalent of two surface - to - surface missile brigades .
The first is equipped with Shehab-1 systems .
This unit consists of six - twelve MAZ-543P TELs and unknown number of MELs .
It is believed to be organized into two - three battalions .
The second is equipped with Shehab-2 and Shehab-3 systems .
It consists of approximately four - six Shehab-2 TELs and four - eight Shehab-3 MELs and is believed to be organized with one - two Shehab-2 and one - two Shehab-3 battalions .
Each brigade is believed to have an operational test and evaluation responsibility for its respective missile systems .
It is likely that a third brigade equipped with the Shehab-3 will be formed by 2005 .
There may also exist a small number of independent Shehab-2 or -3 units of battalion size .
There are also an unknown number of long - range artillery rocket units , some perhaps of brigade size .
US - led Operations Desert Storm and Iraqi Freedom -- while first reducing and then eliminating the military threat from Iraq -- have also crystallized within the Iranian military and political leadership the concepts on ballistic and cruise missiles and long - range artillery rockets : they are essential tools on the modern battlefield ; key elements in regional power status and prestige ; and essential to deter Israel and the United States from aggressive actions against Iran .
From a proliferation standpoint , Iran currently presents a number of challenges .
Primary among these are : The continued willingness of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) , the People's Republic of China ( PRC ) , and Russia to provide Iran with both missiles and missile - related technology that at the very least exceed the intentions of the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) .
This has been complemented , to a lesser extent , by the willingness of other nations ( e.g. , Libya and Syria ) to cooperate within the realm of ballistic missile development .
The ongoing ability and willingness of Iran to fund the development of missiles and missile - related technology in other countries ( e.g. , DPRK , Libya , and Syria ) .
Development of both an indigenous missile design and production capability , and the evolution of a strategic doctrine that foresees Iran as a regional superpower , `` ... a missile power second only to the superpowers , '' and a `` ... center ... '' for other third world nations seeking missile capabilities .
Iran 's ballistic missile capabilities are complemented by extensive nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons programs , which themselves are the recipients of significant foreign assistance .

Work Advances at Iranian Uranium Enrichment Site
Iran has begun preliminary work to install thousands of centrifuges at its uranium enrichment facility as a dispute roiled over whether the International Atomic Energy Agency was receiving the access it wants to monitor the site , wire services reported today ( see GSN , Feb. 1 ) .
Hundreds of workers `` were working feverishly '' to place piping and wiring in Iran 's underground enrichment facility at Natanz , said a diplomat accredited to the agency .
The work is preparation for Iran 's plans to install 3,000 centrifuges at the site , but so far no centrifuges have been emplaced , according to the Associated Press .
Two smaller `` cascades '' of centrifuges have been operating in above-ground buildings at the site since last year , and a smaller set of machinery has been tested underground since November without using any uranium gas , according to AP ( George Jahn , Associated Press / Houston Chronicle , Feb. 2 ) .
The nuclear agency had hoped to monitor the larger centrifuge cascade with cameras , but Iranian officials were `` not allowing the IAEA to install the cameras inside the cascade halls in Natanz and are causing further delays in the inspectors ' activity , '' a diplomat who closely monitors the agency said yesterday .
`` The Iranians are now willing to accept the installation of cameras only outside the cascade halls , which will not enable the IAEA to monitor the entire uranium enrichment process , '' the diplomat said .
`` This way the IAEA will only be able to see the crates that are taken into the hall and the workers coming and going . ''
`` Uranium enrichment will nevertheless proceed inside the halls uninterrupted and unmonitored by the international community , '' the diplomat added ( Michael Adler , Agence France-Presse/Yahoo! News , Feb. 1 ) .
For its part , Iran today denied that it prevented the agency from positioning cameras , but did not specifically address the location of the cameras .
`` The installation of cameras has taken place in Natanz .
We have cooperated with the IAEA based on the safeguards and we will continue to do so in the framework of cooperation and treaties , '' said a senior Iranian diplomat in Tehran .
`` The installation of monitoring systems and surveillance is taking place correctly and in the past days , the monitoring system has been strengthened , and there is no problem regarding this issue between Iran and the agency , '' the official added ( Reuters / New York Times , Feb. 2 ) .
Introduction
China possesses nuclear weapons , a range of ballistic missile capabilities , and the ability to develop chemical and biological weapons .
A key uncertainty is how ongoing military modernization efforts will ultimately reshape China 's strategic nuclear capabilities , but U.S. deployments of missile defenses are likely to be a key variable .
Serious concerns remain about China 's proliferation of ballistic missile technology and its ability to control chemical items that could be used in the production of chemical weapons .
Improved export control laws and enforcement have addressed many ( but not all ) concerns about nuclear and chemical weapons - related proliferation .
Nuclear
China 's nuclear weapons program began in 1955 and culminated in a successful nuclear test in 1964 .
Since then , China has conducted 45 nuclear tests , including tests of thermonuclear weapons and a neutron bomb .
The series of nuclear tests in 1995 - 96 prior to China 's signature of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) may have resulted in a smaller and lighter warhead design for the new generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) now under development .
China is estimated to have about 400 strategic and tactical nuclear weapons , and stocks of fissile material sufficient to produce a much larger arsenal .
China joined the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) in 1984 and acceded to the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) in 1992 as a nuclear weapon state .
China provided nuclear reactors and technology to several countries in the 1980s and early 1990s , including design information and fissile material that reportedly helped Pakistan develop nuclear weapons .
Since the early 1990s , China has improved its export controls , including the promulgation of regulations on nuclear and nuclear dual - use exports and has pledged to halt exports of nuclear technology to un - safeguarded facilities .
In 2002 China ratified the IAEA Additional Protocol , the first and only nuclear weapons state to do so .
Biological
China is a party to most of the major international agreements regulating biological weapons , including the Geneva Protocol and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention ( BWC or BTWC ) .
China is not , however , a member of the Australia Group ( AG ) , a voluntary supply - side export control regime focused on chemical and biological weapons , though the issuance of new export control regulations in 2002 has put Beijing 's export control policy fully in line with that of the AG .
While China has publicly declared to be consistently in compliance with the BTWC , past U.S. government reports have alleged that China not only has a small - scale offensive biological weapons program , but has also transferred controlled biological weapons - related items to nations of proliferation concern such as Iran .
Such transfers have resulted in numerous U.S. nonproliferation sanctions being imposed on Chinese entities .
Chemical
China ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) in December 1996 , declaring two former chemical weapons ( CW ) production facilities that may have produced mustard gas and Lewisite .
Since 1997 , China has hosted 14 on - site inspections by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) .
Although China claims that it no longer possesses any CW stockpiles , the U.S. government believes that China has not revealed the full scope of its program .
China has signed a bilateral agreement with Japan to destroy CW that Japan abandoned in Chinese territory during World War II .
Missile
China has produced and deployed a wide range of ballistic missiles , ranging from short - range missiles to intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) .
China 's missiles are operated by the Second Artillery Corps , and include about 650 DF -11 ( M-11 ) and DF-15 ( M-9 ) missiles opposite Taiwan ; several dozens of DF -3 , DF -4 , and DF -21 medium - range missiles that can reach Japan , India , and Russia ; and 18-24 DF -5 ICBMs that can reach the United States and Europe .
A transition is currently underway from relatively inaccurate , liquid - fueled , silo / cave - based missiles ( DF-3 , DF -4 , DF -5 ) to more accurate , solid - fueled , mobile missiles ( DF-11 , DF-15 , and DF-21 , and a new ICBM [ the DF-31 ] and SLBM [ the JL-2 ] , which are currently under development ) .
China is replacing its older DF-5 missiles with new DF -5A variants , which may eventually be equipped with multiple warheads .
A key question is how U.S. deployment of ballistic missile defense ( formerly known as theater and national missile defense ) will affect the pace and scope of Chinese strategic modernization .
Chinese missile exports have been a problem for more than a decade .
China transferred 36 DF-3 medium - range missiles to Saudi Arabia in 1988 , and supplied Pakistan with 34 M-11 short - range missiles in 1992 .
China has provided technology and expertise to the missile programs of several countries , including Pakistan , Iran , and North Korea .
China has not joined the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) , but has pledged to abide by its main parameters .
In November 2000 , China promised not to assist any country in the development of nuclear - capable ballistic missiles .
In August 2002 , China issued regulations and a control list restricting the export of missiles and missile technology .
Since 2004 , China has been engaged in consultation with the MTCR ; however , its application for membership has so far not been successful and suspicions , especially in the United States , about Chinese missile technology transfers remain .
China 's development of anti - satellite ( ASAT ) capabilities has also raised concerns about China 's missile and related military space program .
On 11 January 2007 , China successfully carried out a test of a direct ascent anti - satellite ( ASAT ) weapon , by using a ballistic missile to destroy an aging weather satellite in orbit approximately 500 miles above the Earth 's surface .
a brief History
Prehistoric man in Asia Minor ( now modern Turkey ) or Greece could look out across the Aegean toward the horizon and see the faint silhouette of land .
Their curiosity pushed them to build vessels that were strong enough to ford the open seas and reach these islands , marking the start of the long legacy of Mediterranean seafaring .
Around 7000 b.c. , the Phoenicians set out from what is now Iran to explore their surroundings .
They eventually reached the islands , and founded colonies on the islands in the northernmost part of the Aegean Sea .
An important early material , obsidian , was discovered on the island of Milos .
Obsidian is a hard , vitreous volcanic rock , which could be fashioned into tools for cutting and stabbing .
The high quality of the seam on Milos ensured that the area remained popular with early travelers .
The basic elements of life in the Aegean began to come together as early as 5000 b.c. , and were already in place by the late Bronze Age ( c. 2700 b.c. ) .
The major changes were not to daily tasks and routines , but to the political power base , which changed regularly and not necessarily peacefully throughout the ages .
Cycladic Culture
At around 3500 b.c. , a sophisticated culture evolved in the Cyclades islands .
The distinctive , sculpted marble figures of the era are now being reproduced in vast quantities as souvenirs .
You will find original examples in the archaeological museums throughout the Cyclades , although one of the earliest examples is in the museum on Paros .
The people farmed and fished ; on the dawning of the Bronze Age in 2700 b.c. , they began to work with metals .
The Cycladic culture was influenced by societies in the east , importing the pottery wheel from Mesopotamia .
They also continued to trade in obsidian and the local marble .
The Minoans and the Myceneans
Farther south in Crete , the Minoan culture developed after 2000 b.c. into the most significant of its age , spreading its influence throughout the region by trade and diplomacy .
Santorini ( Thira ) , the next major island north , was heavily influenced by Crete , and the settlements of Thira and Akrotiri thrived at this time .
The magnificent frescoes and mosaics found at Akrotiri are in Athens at present , but the remains of the buildings at the site provide ample evidence of the sophistication of the culture here .
Around 1500 b.c. , a massive volcanic eruption at Santorini destroyed not only Akrotiri -- under feet of ash and pumice -- but the whole Minoan civilization .
Massive tidal waves swept over Crete , and other parts of the Mediterranean , smashing buildings and drowning many thousands of people .
In the wake of this tremendous natural upheaval , the Aegean Islands next came under the influence of the Mycenaeans ( at around 1300 b.c. ) , who had a base in the Peloponnese region of the Greek mainland .
The Mycenaeans were an acquisitive race who came to conquer , not to trade .
Their extensive military campaigns were later chronicled by Homer in his epic poems The Odyssey and The Iliad .
The Rise of Athens
The Dorians , who came overland from northern Europe , conquered the Mycenaeans .
They were a barbaric race , and their custody of the area brought about a dark period during which the written word was forgotten and art disappeared .
They held sway over islands off the northern Greek coast , but the Phoenicians kept control of the main sea routes ; south of the area , trade continued as usual .
At the same time , city-states began to grow in influence on the southern Greek mainland .
Athens became the most powerful , heralding the start of the classical Greek period .
However , Greece was not yet a country ; each city-state was self-governing and autonomous .
The new culture spread throughout the Mediterranean , helped by a huge increase in migration from the mainland to new settlements such as Carthage , a Greek city on the African coast of the Mediterranean .
Culture and the arts flourished once again .
Athletic prowess was admired and the Olympic games were constituted in 776 b.c. , to promote friendly competition .
Homer wrote his epic works on Chios ; and lyrical poetry was much admired , particularly the work of the poets Archilochos on Paros and Sappho on Lesvos .
The preeminent islands of this era were Delos , a sacred island and center of religion ruled by Athens ; Samos , ruled by the tyrant Polycrates ; and Naxos , whose ruler Lygdamis undertook some major building projects .
Archaeology shows that , during this time , societies lived mainly in coastal trading towns with little settlement inland .
The Persian Wars
As Athens rose in influence and power in the West , it was matched in the East by the rise of the Persian Empire .
From a power base in Anatolia , the Persians overran the eastern Aegean Islands and set their sights on the Cyclades .
In 490 b.c. , they captured sacred Delos and razed the settlements on Naxos .
The island communities were undecided about which side to back for a time .
Paros and Andros contributed to the Persian armory , while others supported Athens .
The two superpowers finally clashed at the epic battles of Marathon and Salamis in 480 b.c. .
The Persians were defeated , and Athens duly punished the islands that had turned against it .
Following its victory , Athens introduced the concept of a mutual protection alliance ( a kind of NATO of the ancient world ) .
Several islands and Greek city-states agreed to work together , and created a treasury to fund their plans , which was held on the island of Delos .
The alliance became known as the Delian League .
Although there were minor internal wrangles , the league controlled the Aegean and the greater Athenian Empire for most of the fifth century b.c. .
Later , in 454 b.c. , the treasury was transferred to Athens and its deposits were used to finance the construction of many of the major buildings and temples of the Classical Age .
In 431 b.c. , Athens began a war with its neighbor and league member Sparta .
Although the islands saw little action , as the war went on they could see that Athens was slowly losing its power .
Before the end of the war in 401 b.c. , many islands had already transferred their allegiance to the victors , who were led by Philip II of Macedon .
He was followed in 336 b.c. by his son Alexander the Great , one of the most remarkable leaders in history .
His rise to power ushered in the Hellenistic period .
Hellenistic and Roman Periods
When Alexander went on to conquer lands as far to the east as India , the Aegean became a crossroads for the long trading routes .
Delos became one of the largest marketplaces in the empire .
Following Alexander 's death , his lands were divided among his generals .
Much of the Aegean came under the rule of the Ptolemies , along with Egypt .
Cleopatra was a member of this famous ruling clan .
Although in 88 b.c. , Mithradates made a swift and successful raid from the East across Asia Minor and the Aegean Islands , the next major power change brought influence from the West .
The Greek Hellenistic Empire was gradually , and peacefully , absorbed into the Roman Empire .
The Byzantine Empire and the Coming of Christianity
The Romans ruled a pagan empire , but the Aegean had an important influence on the early development of Christianity .
In a.d. 95 , St. John arrived on Patmos , a small rocky island in the Dodecanese , as a political prisoner .
It was here that he wrote what was to become the final book of the New Testament , the Book of Revelation .
It was n't until a.d. 330 , however , when the newly converted Emperor Constantine made Byzantium , renamed Constantinople , capital of his Eastern Empire that Christianity was assured of its dominant role in future Greek life .
The Byzantine Empire had powerful and well-fortified cities , but the countryside and the outlying islands were ravaged by waves of invaders .
In an attempt to counter a threat from the Saracen Muslims , a new potent religious force from the East , the Byzantine army forcefully enlisted the men of the islands .
Disease took a further toll .
By the time of the Crusades , many of the Aegean islands had been practically depopulated .
As the Byzantine Empire weakened at the end of the first millennium , Crusader forces were sent from Western Europe to counter the Muslim forces and retake Jerusalem for the Christian faith .
Unfortunately , their zeal was not matched by their discrimination .
The crusaders swept through the land of Byzantium slaughtering Christians as well as Muslims , civilians as well as soldiers .
Constantinople was taken by Crusader forces in 1204 , and they stripped the city of many of its finest treasures -- which now grace the public buildings of Venice -- although a large consignment of books and manuscripts was transferred to the monastery at Patmos before the city fell .
While Byzantine land was being divided , there was no one in control of the seas , so pirates raided towns on many of the islands .
To counter this , the populations moved from their homes on the coast and built settlements inland , out of sight of the raiding parties .
This created a pattern seen today throughout the Aegean of a small port ( skala ) which serves an inland settlement or chora , making it easier to protect the island from attack .
The minor Aegean Islands were taken by various powerful European noblemen , many of whom were Genoese or Venetian , such as Marco Sanudo on Naxos .
The noblemen had free rein to create their own fiefdoms .
The Venetians fortified their main towns -- Naxos Town and Antiparos Town are wonderful examples of this -- creating labyrinths of narrow alleys and cul-de-sacs that were designed to confuse and to demoralize invaders .
The Genoese took control of the eastern Aegean Islands , which were considered the most valuable for agriculture and trade .
After a final bloody defeat by the Muslims in 1309 , Christian forces were forced from the Holy Land .
The Knights of St. John , a holy military force , made their way to Rhodes and Kos in the Dodecanese .
They began the process of building their strong citadels , and reinforcing the Christian faith on the islands .
However , they had not seen the last of their Muslim foe .
A force was gaining strength in the east to threaten their new bases .
The Coming of the Ottoman Turks
The Ottomans were roving invaders who came from the east , taking land in what is now Turkey .
By the end of the 13th century , they began their first raids on the Aegean Islands .
In 1453 , they took Constantinople , and immediately made it their capital , renaming it Istanbul .
They then set their sights on the islands of the Knights of St. John and , after an unsuccessful siege in 1480 , they finally ejected the knights from the Dodecanese in 1522 .
In 1566 , they wrested Chios from the Genoese , bolstering their hold on the eastern Aegean Islands , but the Cyclades remained in Venetian hands for another generation or more -- Tinos was the last to fall in 1715 .
The Ottomans brought new influences to the islands that they controlled , forming a large empire that stretched around the eastern Mediterranean .
Toward Greek Independence
However , a movement was growing on the Greek peninsula against Ottoman rule and for an independent Greek state .
In 1770 , Russia came to aid the Greeks ( defined by their Orthodox religion rather than by historical geographical boundaries ) , declaring war on the Ottoman Empire and occupying several Aegean islands until 1774 .
Graffiti written by Russian soldiers can be seen in the caves of Antiparos .
Although this attempt was unsuccessful , the campaign for a Greek state continued into the 19th century and began to grow in strength .
The Aegean Islands played their part .
Lesvos , Chios , and Samos lay in the important shipping lanes , and patriots began disrupting Ottoman cargo traffic .
In return , the Turks violently put down every insurrection , including the massacre on Chios , when 22,000 people were slaughtered .
The Ottoman Empire was weakening , however , and in 1821 , the peoples of the Greek mainland achieved nationhood for the first time .
The Cyclades and the Sporades island chains were also included in this new state .
A new sense of identity enveloped Greek peoples throughout the Aegean , thus commencing a movement to expand Greece and unify the disparate Orthodox populations .
The Twentieth Century
A series of disastrous decisions at the beginning of the 20th century began to sound a death knell for the Ottoman Empire .
The Turks lost a short war with Italy , and were forced to relinquish the Dodecanese islands to the Italians .
Greece took this opportunity to absorb the islands of the northern and eastern Aegean and to add Macedonia to its mainland territories .
Following this debacle , the Ottomans then allied themselves to Germany in the World War I , losing more territory with the defeat of the Germans in that war .
Greece was handed a strip of land along the western coast of Asia Minor , which for over 2,000 years had had a substantial Greek population .
Greece moved in to administer the land , but a new influence upset any grand dreams of making this region a part of greater Greece .
In 1923 , Turkey broke away from the tired Ottoman rulers , and Kemal Ataturk rose to power on a wave of popular support .
He promised a modern state for his people , but as the situation became volatile , civil strife broke out in Turkish cities , and those considered Greek were victims of threats and violence .
Many had to leave their birthplaces , fleeing to Lesvos , Chios , and Samos , the Greek-ruled islands just offshore .
Thousands of people arrived with little more than the clothes they wore , putting great strain on the resources of the islands .
Finally , Greece was ousted from its new territory in Asia Minor , which became part of the new Turkish state .
Greece attempted to stay out of World War II , but Mussolini saw Greece as an ideal addition to his Italian empire .
His forces made a series of attacks from their bases in the Dodecanese islands , including sinking a Greek naval vessel in the harbor of Tinos Town , but they only succeeded in strengthening the resolve of the population against them .
Later the Germans came in force and occupied many of the islands .
After the war , in 1949 , the Dodecanese islands finally became part of the Greek nation .
But the country was politically fragmented , with arguments between monarchists and republicans , right and left , and tension escalated into civil war .
The struggle bypassed most of the islands , although there was fierce fighting on Samos .
Even after the fighting stopped more than a decade later , the country was not stable .
At the same time , the massive growth in air and road transport saw shipping decline in importance .
The Aegean Islands , which for centuries had been important ports on the trading routes , became the backwaters of this new transport network and the economies of several islands came close to collapse .
In 1967 , the military took the reins of power in Athens , and until 1974 , the `` Colonels '' held sway with a repressive and brutal regime .
Many Greek islanders chose to leave rather than live in poverty and terror , and many made new homes in the United States and Australia .
The expansion of air travel began the age of mass tourism , and Greece along with the Aegean Islands became exciting destinations for northern Europeans escaping their damp , cool summers .
In 1982 , Greece joined the European Common Market ( now the European Union ) .
Since this time , membership has been of great monetary benefit to the country .
The EU has given large subsidies to develop Greece 's infrastructure and grants to excavate and protect its ancient monuments .
Airfields have been constructed on a number of the islands , and road systems have been expanded and improved .
Private investment has even made an increasingly modern ferry fleet possible .
Politically , the 1990s have been relatively quite times for the islands , although the divorce of Greek prime minister Andreas Papandreou and his subsequent marriage to a much younger woman caused consternation within conservative Greek society .
As the Balkans flared to war once again , Greek nationalism has stirred , and there have been discussions in the kafeneion about the land of Macedonia returning to the fold of its forefathers .
Whether this will ever happen remains to be seen , but perhaps the aid offered by Greece to Turkey after 1999 's devastating earthquake is a sign that the animosity between these two traditional enemies is beginning to diminish .

Introduction
The collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991 left the Russian Federation with the bulk of the massive Soviet weapons of mass destruction complex .
This legacy has allowed Russia to retain its great power status even as its economy has collapsed , but the burden of supporting this oversized complex has strained the Russian political and economic system .
Russia 's nuclear and missile capabilities presupposes its crucial role in arms control and nonproliferation , while the remnants of chemical and biological weapons programs pose major environmental and proliferation threats .
Nuclear
The Soviet nuclear weapon program began during World War II and culminated in a successful atomic bomb test in 1949 .
Russia , as the successor of the Soviet Union , is a nuclear weapon state party to the Non - Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) .
According to estimates by the Natural Resources Defense Council , by 1991 , the Soviet Union had approximately 35,000 weapons in its stockpile , down from a peak in 1986 of approximately 45,000 .
Russia is estimated to now have around 20,000 nuclear weapons , although total stockpile size is uncertain because there is no accurate count of tactical nuclear weapons .
However , in 2002 Russia declared it will eliminate its tactical nuclear weapons by the end of 2004 .
Under the START I Treaty , the Russian nuclear arsenal has been reduced to approximately 7,000 strategic warheads .
The START II Treaty , which was declared non - binding in June 2002 , would have reduced this number to between 3,000 and 3,500 strategic nuclear warheads .
The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty ( Treaty of Moscow ) requires Russia to reduce the number of deployed strategic warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 by the end of 2012 .
Russia inherited a massive nuclear weapons production complex and large stocks of weapons grade fissile material .
It is estimated that Russia has between 735 and 1,365 metric tons ( t ) of weapons grade - equivalent highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) and between 106 and 156 t of military - use plutonium .
Biological
The Soviet Union ratified the BWC in 1975 .
Nevertheless , the Soviet Union violated the treaty by secretly operating a massive offensive BW program until it dissolved in 1991 .
The Soviet BW arsenal included the causative agents of anthrax , smallpox , plague , tularemia , glanders , and hemorrhagic fever .
In wartime , formulated agents would have been loaded into a variety of delivery systems , including aerial bombs and ballistic missile warheads .
Soviet BW scientists also researched , developed , and produced anti - crop and anti - livestock agents .
Although the U.S. government believes that the BW agent stockpiles have been destroyed , activities that contravene the BWC may continue at a few military biological facilities in Russia .
The Soviet Union also established a so - called anti - plague system , whose primary objective was to control endemic diseases and prevent the importation of exotic pathogens that could threaten crops , animals , and humans .
In the late 1960s , however , the system also was tasked with defending the USSR against biological attacks .
The anti - plague system continues in today 's Russia .
There are reports that some countries , including Iran , have attempted to hire Russian BW specialists to help them acquire biological weapons .
Chemical
During the Cold War , and afterwards , the Soviet Union had the world 's largest arsenal of chemical weapons , including artillery shells , bombs , and missiles that contained choking agents ( phosgene ) , nerve agents ( sarin , soman , and VX ) , and blister agents ( mustard , lewisite , and mustard - lewisite mixture ) .
There have been allegations that the Soviet Union developed a new class of nerve agent ( Novichok ) , estimated to be 5 - 10 times more toxic than VX .
Russia inherited the declared Soviet stockpile of 40,000 metric tons of CW munitions and agents stored in bulk .
In November 1997 , Russia ratified the CWC , but financial and other difficulties have impeded the destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile , so it is far behind the timetable specified in the treaty .
Missile
Russia inherited most of the Soviet missile complex , although significant portions are located in Ukraine .
Russia has the capability to produce highly sophisticated liquid - and solid - fueled missiles of all ranges .
The RS -12M2 Topol-M ( NATO designation SS-27 ) intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) has been developed for silo basing and mobile basing model is under development .
Although the possibility of deploying a MIRVed variant of the SS-27 has also been discussed in the past , no steps in that direction appear to have been taken yet .
In the meantime , Russia continues to extend service lives of existing types of MIRVed ICBMs .
While no sea - launched ballistic missile ( SLBM ) is currently in production , Russia is developing a new SLBM called the Bulava , which is to be deployed in the existing Typhoon class submarines and in the future in a new class of ballistic missile submarines currently under construction .
It is planned that in the future a modification of Bulava will also be deployed in silos as a MIRVed ICBM .
There are also plans to start production of an upgraded SS-N-23 variant , designated Sineva , and the Air Force reportedly began to receive a new type of strategic cruise missile .
Reports of exports and leakage of Russian missile technology to countries such as Iran , India , China , Libya , and North Korea have led to concerns that Russia is contravening its obligations as a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) .

The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake .
During this period , the indigenous people lived in caves , hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline .
The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries .
The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated .
Fossils tell an obscure story of man 's slow and sporadic development .
Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture .
By this time , the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today , with one exception -- the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas .
These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River .
The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases : sprawling collections of grasses , trees , and wildlife .
Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis .
For about 4000 years , the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization .
Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley .
Far more progressive than the Archaics , the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest .
This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society -- the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife .
Mysteriously , the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d. 1150 , leaving it to be repopulated by the Southern Paiutes , another hunter-gatherer tribe .
Unable to replicate the agricultural techniques of the Anasazi , the Paiutes were destined to a semi-nomadic lifestyle until European settlers arrived , changing the nature of existence in the valley forever .
From Mailmen to Mormons
In the early nineteenth century , America 's western territories were still largely unexplored .
It was not until 1829 that Rafael Rivera , a Mexican scout , found a spring -fed valley and dubbed it Las Vegas -- a Spanish name that leaves many modern visitors wondering exactly where `` the meadows '' really lay .
For fifteen years , Las Vegas was used as a Spanish Trail way-station .
In 1844 , American explorer John C. Fremont parked his horses at Big Springs , and his report to the government resulted in a mail route leading past the spot on its way to California .
This put Las Vegas on the map and was one of the crucial turning points of its history .
In 1855 , Mormon leader Brigham Young responded to promising reports of Las Vegas by sending 30 missionary settlers to the valley ; they eventually built a fort not far from today 's Downtown .
Surrounded by acres of farmland hewn from the hard desert , the adobe fort became a focal point for the development of Las Vegas for the next fifty years .
The missionaries struggled valiantly against the dictates of the desert , trying simultaneously to survive the harshness of their circumstances and spread the Mormon faith .
Additional pressures from arriving miners pushed the missionaries ' plight beyond recovery .
Their supplies scarce , their harvest meager , and their spirit broken , they abandoned the fort in 1858 .
Despite the fact that the local land was rich in silver , by 1865 most of the mining traffic through Las Vegas was of prospectors headed to California or Northern Nevada in search of gold .
One opportunist who stayed was Octavius Decatur Gass .
Bestowed with plenty of the invaluable pioneer spirit that characterizes Las Vegas to this day , Gass redirected his life by picking up where the Mormons left off -- at least when it came to ranching and farming .
Gass took over the abandoned Mormon fort and 640 acres ( 260 hectares ) surrounding it , dubbing it the Las Vegas Ranch .
He expanded the ranch and irrigated the land so that it would support crops and cattle .
His determination had other results as well : Gass was named a justice of the peace and a territorial legislator .
Despite his ambition , Gass ' success was short-lived .
In the late 1870s , he defaulted on a loan from rancher Archibald Stewart , so Stewart took the Las Vegas Ranch for his own .
True to wild-West stereotypes , Stewart was slain by a neighboring farmer , leaving his strong-willed wife , Helen , to assume the duties of the ranch .
Through 1905 , Helen Stewart expanded the ranch to 2000 acres ( 810 hectares ) , making quite a bit of money in the process .
What happened next would mark the end of the successful Las Vegas Ranch and the beginning of the era of the subdivision seen across almost all of Western America to this day .
The railroad was coming , and when it arrived , Las Vegas would never be the same again .
Of Tracks and Tracts
At the turn of the 19th century Los Angeles and Salt Lake City were among the burgeoning metropolises of the new American West .
Though the two cities remained unlinked by rail , this was about to change quickly .
When it did , the Las Vegas Valley ( which at the time had a non-native population of less than 30 ) would change as well .
In 1903 , officials of the San Pedro , Los Angeles , and Salt Lake Railroad arrived in Las Vegas , eager to secure a right-of-way for their Los Angeles - Salt Lake connection .
Las Vegas would serve as a major stopover for crew rest and train repair .
For all this , the railroad needed land .
As mapped , the track traveled directly through Helen Stewart 's Las Vegas Ranch .
Stewart sold 99.5 percent of her ranch to the railroad .
The remainder she returned to the native Paiutes .
In early 1905 , the route between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City was completed , and train tracks bore right down the center of the Las Vegas Valley .
On 15 May 1905 , the railroad held a land sale -- a momentous step in Las Vegas history .
Standing at the depot at Main and Fremont streets , railroad officials auctioned 1200 lots they had subdivided from forty square blocks of desert scrub .
Land speculators and locals alike were anxious to own a part of the newest railroad boomtown , and within an afternoon , more than 80 percent of the lots were sold .
Las Vegas was no longer a small pioneer settlement .
With rail service in place and forty blocks of private property , it was ready to become a real town .
Businesses sprang up overnight , and wooden houses were erected to replace the tent city in which many of the early settlers had lived .
One year after the auction , the population of Las Vegas had ballooned to 1500 residents , a portent of things to come for the next ninety years .
Dam Good Luck
From the beginning , Las Vegas was built to serve travelers .
The railroad needed a way station , and Las Vegas was the place .
Growth continued for ten years , and by 1915 the town had telephones , round-the-clock electricity , and a growing population -- many of whom worked in the railroad repair shop .
But such heady progress would soon come to a halt .
The growing competition in rail transport resulted in Union Pacific buying the Los Angeles - Salt Lake line .
Union Pacific then consolidated its operations , eliminating the Las Vegas repair facility .
Additionally , Las Vegas had been made a part of Nevada 's new Clark County in 1909 , a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling .
These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community that could no longer support its 3000 residents .
But the southwest 's growing need for water , combined with Las Vegas 's fortuitous proximity to the Colorado River , would give Las Vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity .
Construction on Hoover Dam ( originally Boulder Dam , subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project ) began in 1931 in a canyon 45 miles ( 72 km ) southeast of Las Vegas .
Providing an influx of $165 million to the southwestern economy , Hoover Dam played a major role in preventing Las Vegas from drying up , both financially and literally .
Not only did it create jobs , but it also created Lake Mead , the massive reservoir that today provides water to all of southern Nevada .
More Government Help
The construction of Hoover Dam did not single-handedly save Las Vegas , however .
The state legislature helped as well , by legalizing gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the future of the town , though legislators and residents could never have known this at the time .
The hordes of people who attended Hoover Dam 's 1935 dedication set the city 's now-formidable public relations machine into action .
They went to work on what has become one of the lengthiest citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted .
It did n't take long for the city to establish itself as a wild- West town with an `` anything goes '' attitude .
Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal here , available any hour of any day ( or night ) .
Thus originated Las Vegas 's reputation as an adult theme park .
Additional catalysts for the valley 's growth came from World War II .
Both the Las Vegas Aerial Gunnery School ( which became Nellis Air Force Base and the Nevada Test Site ) in the north , and Basic Magnesium in the nearby town of Henderson , arrived in the early 1940s as a result of America 's war effort .
By 1945 , the population had grown to almost 20,000 , with workers and airmen moving in at a rapid pace .
But this was not yet the Las Vegas of folklore .
Mobsters and Rat Packers
While many gambling halls opened Downtown in the 1930s and early 1940s , only two were built on the stretch of old Los Angeles Highway that ultimately became the Strip .
The El Rancho Vegas ( 1941 ) was the first , followed by the Last Frontier ( 1943 ) .
During this period , East Coast Syndicate member Benjamin 'Bugsy ' Siegel earned a foothold as a local casino operator .
By 1945 Siegel had become one of Las Vegas 's original visionaries , planning an opulent resort on the southern end of the LA Highway .
When the Flamingo opened in December 1946 , it did so with Hollywood flair and the new Vegas flash .
But the Mafia bosses who financed the operation were displeased with its performance ; Siegel was murdered in the summer of 1947 .
Despite its initial failings , Siegel 's Flamingo survived him , as did mob infiltration of casinos .
In fact , the Flamingo would launch over two decades of strong mob presence in Las Vegas .
Freely flowing `` comps '' ( complimentary food , drink , and entertainment ) were the order of the day , with mob bosses content to provide an environment of pleasurable excess as long as the cash kept rolling in .
While the mob was running the casinos , promoters were busily selling Las Vegas as a glamorous Hollywood in the desert .
From the mid- 1940s to the mid-1960s , Las Vegas nurtured a growing sense that it was the `` Entertainment Capital of the World .
``
Emerging stars , no longer content with playing small nightclubs , came to Las Vegas with dreams of making it big .
Many of them did .
Frank Sinatra , Wayne Newton , and Louis Prima each arrived with mediocre status and suddenly found themselves with names as big as the marquees on which they were written .
The Rat Pack -- originally Frank Sinatra , Dean Martin , Sammy Davis Jr. , Peter Lawford , and Joey Bishop , all in town to film Ocean 's 11 -- landed at the Sands in January 1960 for a legendary stay .
Other Hollywood stars came as well , simply because Las Vegas was the place to be .
As a result , more casinos emerged along the Strip .
The Thunderbird , Desert Inn , Sahara , Sands , and Riviera hotels were erected during this period , luring a curious clientele drawn by tales of all-night partying , exclusive entertainment , and cheap accommodations .
There was no longer any question : when you wanted some unbridled adult fun , Las Vegas was the place to be .
New Legitimacy
Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas -- corporate cash .
Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy , few major outside investments were made in the city , due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities .
That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes .
A legitimate businessman , Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic , a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos .
True to the myth , the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn 's penthouse .
Several weeks later he was asked -- then ordered -- to vacate the room to make room for high rollers , whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management .
Thus began Hughes ' legendary three-year , $300-million Las Vegas buying spree .
When it was over , Hughes owned six casinos , an airport , and an airline , along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains .
Hughes ' actions would have beneficial repercussions , both immediate and lasting .
Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes ' investments , established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business , and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos , where illegal skimming of profits was rampant .
That , combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board , would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city .
Las Vegas with a Vision
As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out , a new Las Vegas emerged .
The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US .
What was once a sure thing became much more competitive .
Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business .
The first to really do so was Steve Wynn , a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget .
In the mid-1980s , Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort .
He bought several Strip properties -- the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them -- and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort -- Mirage -- which became an instant success .
Wynn 's demolition of the existing properties started a trend that , more than any other , describes Las Vegas at the end of the 20th century : removal of old properties in exchange for the potential of new ones .
This trend has led to many more demolitions , including the Dunes ( replaced by Bellagio ) , Aladdin ( the new Aladdin ) and Sands ( Venetian ) hotels .
Wynn 's casinos have also set new standards .
They can no longer be just a box filled with gaming tables , restaurants , and a showroom .
Excalibur , the MGM Grand , the Luxor , and New York - New York all followed Mirage 's lead during the 1990s , offering themed environments and attractions for families .
As evidence of the `` ever-faster '' nature of the city , by the middle of the 1990s the new approach showed signs of backlash , with many visitors criticizing the mediocrity of the Las Vegas experience .
The latest approach is perhaps the best of the post-mob era : the comprehensive resort .
New resorts offer attractions and amenities modeled after those available in top resort cities worldwide , including luxurious spas , signature restaurants , and exclusive boutiques .
Additionally , a handful of resorts -- such as the South-Seas themed Mandalay Bay , the Mirage , and the new Four Seasons -- are now catering exclusively to the luxury travel market .
The creme de la creme of Las Vegas deluxe is Steve Wynn 's Bellagio .
The world 's most expensive resort at $1.6 billion , the Bellagio 's amenities include 5-star dining , Chanel-caliber boutiques , and a world-class collection of artistic masterworks .
Perhaps more important , such high-end accommodations raise the standards of expectations back to the mythology of the Rat Pack era .
As it changed from mob gambling town to corporate gaming venue , the population of Las Vegas skyrocketed .
Over 20,000 additional hotel rooms have been added in a few short years , including resorts in Summerlin and Lake Las Vegas .
Recent business projections for Las Vegas predict challenges ; tourism revenues must increase substantially to sustain what is already built , while actual figures show visitation as steady or declining .
The growth that has characterized Las Vegas for nearly a century may be facing a roadblock .
Still , the future of Las Vegas is sure to be determined as much by the pioneering spirit that built the city as by anything else .
With its new look and new aim , the prospects are good despite the warnings .
Inevitably , some people will get burned in the process , but others will rise triumphantly from the fray to even greater successes .
And that , more than anything , is the one constant that characterizes the past , present , and future of Las Vegas .
Greece wildfires force thousands to evacuate
Thousands of people in Greece have been forced to evacuate their homes after major wildfires continued for their third day in the suburbs outside of Athens .
10,000 people were evacuated out of one town , Agios Stefanos , located 23 kilometres from downtown Athens , after the flames headed for the area .
All residents were ordered to take the main highway to Athens .
The deputy mayor of the town , Panayiotis Bitakos , told Skai TV that `` I call on all residents to follow the instructions of the police as to where they will go .
We had been begging the authorities since early in the morning to send forces [ ... ] It is too late now .
Too late . ''
Athens Prefect Yannis Sgouras told state NET TV that strong winds helped strengthen the fires , and caused extra difficulties for the firefighters trying to put out the blaze .
He said that approximately 120 square kilometres have been burned so far .
'' More than 120,000 stremmas [ 30,000 acres ] have been burnt .
It is an ecological disaster , '' he said .
In a televised speech on NET , the fire department spokesman Ioannis Kapakis stated that `` the strength of the winds has increased and the situation remains particularly difficult . ”
In total , 83 major fires were reported across Greece from 06.00 yesterday to 18.00 today .
No casualties have yet been reported , and no official property damage tally has yet been made , although Greek media have estimated tens of homes to have been damaged .
The fires are the worst in Greece since 2007 , when heavy wildfires killed 77 people .

And it will come by being friendly with Al Qaeda brothers and all Muslims , by best behavior , avoiding differences , cooperation and working for the good of the group. [ Prophet Mohammd ] said , peace upon him , `` Love and compassion and sympathy between believers is like the human body : if one part of the body is sick , all the other parts of the body will come to its aid. '' mutafaq aley / agreed upon. [ i.e. , one of the accepted or canonical sayings of Mohammed ] 2- Maintaining good Islamic behavior , avoiding all forms of belligerent play , avoiding bad company and confirming any news to the smallest detail .

Sometimes you will be prevented from spreading these ideologies because your work requires too much secrecy .
7- Guard the public money belonging to Al Qaeda .
The Messenger of Allah said , peace upon him , `` The people who waste Allah 's money , their reward will be the fire on Judgment Day . ''
Roah Al Bukhari [ a collection of the Prophet 's sayings made by Al Bukhari ] 8- Give good advice to your superiors and Al Qaeda brothers , and do n't deceive them .
Secondly : Vacations
Take refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan .
`` They alone are true believers who believe in Allah and his Messenger , and when they are with him on a matter of common concern , do not depart without obtaining his leave. '' [ Sura ] Al Noor /The Light [ 24:62 ] .
1- Married member : for each 3 weeks of work , 1 week vacation , Al Qaeda reserves the right to withhold the vacation up to 4 months in special occasions .
2- Single member : for each month of work , there will be 5 days vacation .
Al Qaeda reserves the right to withhold the vacation for an indeterminate period of time on special occasions .
3- Vacation travel application will be submitted 2 and half months prior to travel .
Extra vacation time requests will not be granted except in special circumstances .
Thirdly : Salaries and Travel Tickets
Take refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan .

The member does not have the right to exchange the ticket for money , if he chooses not to travel .
5- The brother who wishes to leave Al Qaeda without legal excuse does not have the right to demand any financial assistance or special favors when he departs .
Forthly : Rewards and Punishments
Take refuge in Allah from the evil Satan .
`` The answer of believers when they are called to Allah and his Messenger that he may judge between them is , 'We hear and obey. ' They are the ones who will prosper . ''
[ Sura ] Al Noor /The Light [ 24:52 ] .
And Allah said , `` When they are told , 'come to that which Allah has revealed and to the Messenger , ' you should see the hypocrites how they hesitate and turn their faces away. '' [ Sura ] Al Nisa'/The Women [ 4:61 ] .
And Allah said , `` No believing men and women have any choice in a matter after Allah has decided it .
Whoever disobeys Allah and his Messenger has clearly lost the way and gone astray. '' [ Sura ] Al Ahzab / The Allied Troops [ 33:36 ] , and therefore : 1- Accomplish all Al Qaeda 's different plans and missions according to the Shara'a Judicial System .
2- Differences between members regarding Al Qaeda missions will be judged by qualified Al Qaeda members .
This will be done through the direct superior up the chain of command to resolve the matter .
3- If the differences are not related to Al Qaeda 's work , the judgment will be made either by qualified Al Qaeda members or outside judges if the parties wish to do so .
This does not include the Tempter 's courts .
It means any court considered legitimate by Al Qaeda .
This includes high-ranking Al Qaeda and subordinates .
Fifthly : Advice
A- Maintain the conditions of religious equilibrium .
Equilibrium is the fulfillment of the person 's needs for righteousness , which depends on the following : ( 1 ) Religious devotion , which is to fulfill religious duties continuously , and to prevent oneself from falling into the ways of sin. ( 2 ) Embody the ideal of manhood : this is by doing the right things , which will bring praise , and avoiding the wrong things , which would bring shame .
Allah said , `` If they did what they had been advised to do , it would be better for them and they would stand fast. '' [ Sura ] Al Nisa'/The Women , and Abu Al Drda ' said , `` O people , good deeds before the fight , you are fighting with your good deeds . ''
Fatah al Bari 24/6 .
B- Try your best and to the most of your ability to accomplish the rightful Al Qaeda goals .
The Mighty Allah said , `` Fear Allah as much as you can. '' [ Sura ] Al Taghabun /Exposition [ 64 :16 ] , and [ Prophet Mohammed ] said , peace upon him , `` Whatever I order you , do the best you can , '' mutafaq aley / agreed upon .
To do your best to the utmost of your ability is shown by the following:
( 1 ) The best of your efforts should be to your religion , and not to worldly concerns or to your family .
`` You tell them , 'If your fathers and sons , your brothers and wives and families and wealth , or the business you fear may fail , and the mansions that you love , are dearer to you than Allah , his Messenger , and struggling in his cause , then wait until Allah 's command arrives , for Allah does not show transgressors the way. '' [ Sura ] Al Tuba /Repentance [ 9:24 ] [ Prophet Mohammed ] said , peace upon him , `` You are not a believer until you love me more than your parents , your children and all the people . ''
Roah al Bekhari . ( 2 ) That your Jihad be in the service of your religion is more excellent than the infidel struggling for their iniquity ; their struggle is void .
Allah said , `` There are some people who have loves other than Allah ; the believer loves Allah more . ''
C- Pursue the curriculum of religious law studies ; take advantage of spare time to do so .
That will provide the Muslim brother with Islamic vision with regard to current events .
But knowledge without action is a curse to its owner ; there is no value to knowledge without action .
D- If you have a specialty , which is of value to Al Qaeda 's goals , then tell your superior of it .
E- We advise all brothers to avoid arguments in religion , and it is forbidden to speak on religion without knowledge .
If any differences occur , relay them to the qualified members .
Allah said , `` And when any tidings of peace or war come to them they spread the news around .
Had they gone to the Prophet or those in authority among them , then those who check and scrutinize would have known it. '' [ Sura ] Al Nisa' /The Women [ 4:83 ] .
Sixthly : the Covenant
Its Purpose and Religious Lawfulness :
1- Draft Covenant : Covenants among Moslems regarding obedience are permitted and lawful , in order to build trust among the parties .
The proof is in the saying of Allah to Jacob , peace be upon him , '' He said , 'I will never send him with you until you swear by Allah that you will bring him back to me , unless all of you are overtaken ( by misfortune ) .''
When all of them had given their promise , he said : `` Allah is witness to our conversation. '' [ Sura ] Yosef/Joseph [ 12:66 ] .
If a Moslem gives his word he must keep it .
As Allah said , `` And keep the covenant because you are responsible. '' [ Sura ] Al Isra ' .
And Allah said , `` Fulfill your covenant with Allah , having made the covenant , and do not break your oaths once you have sworn them , as you have made Allah a witness over you. '' [ Sura ] Al Nahal /The Bees [ 16:91 ] .
2- The purpose of the Covenant : There are two types of covenants : the religious lawful duty , and the permissible .
The religious lawful duty , such as al-Jihad and the obedience to higher authorities , is every Muslim 's duty by religious law .
In such a case , allegiance means enforcing the religious lawful duty .
Even without allegiance , it is still a lawful religious duty .
While in the case of permissible matters , allegiance makes them religious lawful duties .
He founded this case on the saying of the Mighty Allah , `` If you promise , you have to fulfill your promise . ''
Therefore Al Qaeda will take allegiance from its followers to include the obedience to its policies and goals .
First of all , the Amir swears a Covenant
In the name of Allah the Most Benevolent , ever Merciful , I swear allegiance to Allah , and with his accord to become a soldier among the Muslim soldiers , to support the religion of Allah in order to make Allah 's words supreme .
Covenant sworn by the brother , the Mujahed
In the name of Allah , the Most Benevolent , ever Merciful , I swear allegiance to Allah , and with his accord to obey and listen to my superiors in good times and bad times , in good situations and bad ones , to support the religion of Allah in order to make Allah 's words supreme , and to become a fighter in the name of Allah .
To fight in any position through the duration of the struggle , and to keep all the secrets of Al Qaeda 's missions .
Allah will be my guarantor of what I am saying .
Seventhly : Breach of Covenant
Punishment of the one who breaches the Covenant:
And Allah said , `` As for those who break Allah 's covenant after validating it , and sever relations which Allah ordained cohered , and spread corruption in the land , there is condemnation for them and an evil abode. '' [ Sura ] Al Rad /Thunder [ 13:25 ] .
And the Messenger of Allah said , `` peace be upon him . ''
Allah said , '' Three persons I am the opponent of on the Day of Judgment : a man who promised and broke his promise ; a man who made a sale and cheated , and a man who hired an employee and did not pay him . ''
Roah Al Bukhari .
And Ibn Hajr explained , `` He promised by Allah and then broke his promise. '' [ Sura ] Fatah Al Bari 418 / 4
At last we pray praise to Allah , the Lord of all the worlds .

Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD , to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator .
Although individuals with Asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism , the extent of the overlap between Asperger syndrome , HFA , and non-syndromal autism is unclear .
It presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word 'I ' has been forgotten and replaced with 'we ' .
However , some former NBI students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated , with the problem being concentrated among Rand 's closest followers in New York .
However , by the time she wrote ''The Fountainhead '' , Rand had turned against Nietzsche 's ideas , and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed .
It is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin , or to what extent they influenced each other .

Introduction
Iran 's interest in nuclear technology dates back to the US Atoms for Peace program .
In the 1950s , the Shah initiated Iran 's nuclear research program and developed an ambitious plan to produce 23,000 MW from nuclear power by the end of the century .
Early progress was not steady , and the nuclear program was stalled by the Islamic revolution in 1979 , then the eight - year war with Iraq through most of the 1980s .
The program was revived later in the decade , when strategic interests began to drive the nuclear program .
Under the Khomeini regime , Iran 's nuclear program steadily grew on all fronts and stages of the nuclear fuel cycle , with a particular emphasis on developing and strengthening indigenous capabilities .
Partly as a result of the shortcomings in the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) safeguards system -- which allowed the rapid development of the Iraqi nuclear program in the 1970s and North Korea 's in the 1990s to go largely undetected -- and partly by assessing Iran 's intentions , the international community and the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) have increased their scrutiny of Iran 's activities over the last several years .
The most alarming developments were revealed in 2002 - 03 , during which time Iran admitted to having construction plans for two enrichment facilities , a heavy water production plant , a fuel fabrication plant , and undertaken research into conversion and enrichment activities ( including centrifuges and possibly lasers ) .
On 19 August 2003 , Iran began testing a ten - machine cascade at the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz with uranium hexafluoride ( UF6 ) .
After announcing on 21 October 2003 that it would cooperate with the IAEA , Iran signed the Additional Protocol to the NPT on 18 December .
All Iran 's research activities in the recent past undoubtedly contribute to the future development of a complete nuclear fuel cycle , which in turn would enable Iran to weaponize without relying on outside assistance .
History
Although Iran began developing its nuclear program in the 1950s , it was slow to progress until late in the 1960s , when the US - supplied 5 MW thermal research reactor ( TRR ) went online at the Tehran Nuclear Research Center ( TNRC ) .
In 1973 , spurred by an influx of oil revenues , the Shah of Iran embarked on an ambitious goal of modernizing the country and building its image abroad .
He did this by shifting the country 's budgets toward the military and the newly established Atomic Energy Organization of Iran ( AEOI ) .
The Shah set his goal high : `` ... get , as soon as possible , 23,000 MW from nuclear power stations . ''
In 1968 , Iran signed the NPT in an effort to speed up its negotiations for nuclear agreements , particularly with the United States .
In 1970 , the government ratified the NPT and its obligations went into force .
In the five years that followed , Iran concluded several contracts for the construction of nuclear plants and the supply of nuclear fuel : with the United States in 1974 ; Germany in 1976 ; and France in 1977 .
In 1976 , Iran also purchased a stake in Eurodif 's ( the European consortium ) Tricastin uranium enrichment plant in France and purchased a stake in the RTZ uranium mine in Rossing , Namibia .
Also in 1976 , the government signed a $700 million contract to purchase uranium yellowcake from South Africa and sent Iranian technicians abroad for training in nuclear sciences .
In addition to his grand plans for nuclear power , the Shah placed a great emphasis on establishing and developing a nuclear research program .
Although the Shah had no specific plans to engage in research of uranium reprocessing or enrichment , the scientists at the AEOI 's newly equipped TNRC were reportedly given great discretion regarding the nature and direction of experiments conducted .
According to former head of AEOI , Akbar Etemad , the Shah 's interest in nuclear technology did not involve military applications , in fact the Shah `` considered it absurd , under the existing circumstances , to embark on anything else but a purely civilian program . ''
However , according to recently revealed documents discovered in Tehran after the revolution , in the late 1970s Iran and Israel discussed a plan to modify Israel 's surface - to - surface Jericho missiles for use by Iran -- missiles that could be equipped with nuclear weapons .
And , despite Akbar Etemad 's beliefs , the Western intelligence community had long suspected that the Shah 's nuclear scientists conducted research into military applications .
Suspected activities at the TNRC include nuclear weapons design , plutonium extraction and laser - enrichment research .
By the time of the Islamic Revolution in January 1979 , Iran 's nuclear program was considered one the most advanced in the Middle East .
In the immediate aftermath of the revolution , Iran 's ambitious nuclear program fell apart due to the initial opposition by the Khomeini government to nuclear technology and because of the exodus of many of Iran 's nuclear scientists .
Additionally , the insufficiency of the existing electrical infrastructure and dwindling oil revenues contributed to the withdrawal of foreign suppliers from Iran and the abandonment of nuclear power agreements .
Iran 's only nuclear power plants in 1979 were the two plants under construction at Bushehr , under contract with Germany 's Siemens .
The weapons research side of Iran 's nuclear activities seemed to have continued uninterrupted by the revolution , and received a major boost when a new nuclear research center opened at Isfahan in 1984 .
From its inception , the revolutionary government was forced to face external challenges in addition to domestic instability .
Invasion by Iraq and the loss of Iran 's powerful ally , the United States , must have contributed to Iran 's sense of political and military vulnerability .
Eight years of war with Iraq , multiple bombings of the Bushehr reactor site , chemical attacks on its forces , missile strikes on its cities , and an overall drain on its resources would certainly have had a devastating effect on Iran .
In addition to feeling threatened by Iraq 's growing nuclear program , these attacks may explain why the Khomeini government ultimately resumed its efforts to continue Iran 's nuclear power program and strengthen its existing nuclear research program -- and ultimately to develop nuclear weapons .
As the Cold War ended , the strategic environment around Iran changed .
After the 1979 hostage crisis at the US embassy in Tehran , the United States withdrew its support from Iran , cut all nuclear cooperation agreements , and , in fact , supported Iraq during the war .
China , North Korea , and , to a certain extent , Syria emerged as major suppliers of conventional arms to Iran .
Help from China and North Korea , however , was not limited to conventional weaponry .
By this time , Iran was shopping for a new bidder to complete the Bushehr project .
The late 1980s saw a rise of several new potential exporters of nuclear assistance .
Pakistan and China signed long - term nuclear cooperation agreements with Iran in 1987 and 1990 , respectively .
Accords with both countries involved training personnel , and in the case of China , the accord included an agreement to provide Iran with a 27 KW miniature neutron source reactor ( MNSR ) and two 300 MW Qinshan power reactors .
Western intelligence suspected that Pakistan , which many estimated had succeeded in manufacturing a nuclear bomb in 1986 , provided Iran with nuclear assistance .
Reports in Western press and leaks from Western government and intelligence sources indicated that Pakistan had trained Iranian scientists in plutonium extraction and possibly gas centrifuge enrichment research .
Training was most likely carried out under the direction of Abdul Qadeer Khan , former director of the Engineering Research Laboratories , later renamed the Dr . A.Q. Khan Research Laboratories ( Kahuta ) , where Pakistan 's nuclear weapons research and enrichment takes place .
A.Q. Khan is widely regarded as the father of Pakistan 's nuclear bomb .
The Soviet Union , traditionally an ally of Iraq , had also indicated an interest in cooperating with Iran .
In 1990 , the Soviet Union and Iran began negotiating over the completion of the Bushehr reactors and the supply of additional nuclear plants .
In January 1995 , the Russian Federation formally announced that it would complete the construction of the Bushehr reactors and signed an agreement with Iran to build three additional reactors at the site .
Since the signing of these agreements , the United States has continuously expressed its opposition to the Bushehr deal because of fears that the deal could provide Iran with knowledge and technology to support a nuclear weapons program .
Despite many technical delays ( misfit of original Siemens equipment with Russian technology ) and efforts by the United States to stall the project , frequently by lobbying the Russia government for the cancellation of the deal , most notably during the Gore - Chernomyrdin Commission meetings , the facility is nearing completion .
Over the years , the United States has successfully blocked several of Iran 's nuclear agreements , such as those with Argentina ( uranium enrichment and heavy water production facilities ) , China ( plutonium - producing research reactor , two power reactors and a uranium conversion plant ) , and Russia ( heavy water production plant ) .
In 1995 , it became evident that Iran may be pursuing nuclear weapons through another track : by procuring dual - use items from Western firms .
The United States also learned that Iran and Russia concluded a secret protocol stipulating , among other things , construction of a gas centrifuge enrichment facility .
The fear was that Iran might learn how to construct a similar clandestine facility and then produce weapons - grade uranium undetected .
The United States then imposed extensive sanctions on Iran and successfully pressured Russia and other potential suppliers , mostly in Europe , to halt exports of sensitive dual - use nuclear technology to Iran , such as high - voltage switches that could trigger a nuclear weapon and specialized remote manipulators designed to handle heavy volumes of radioactive material and possibly intended for a uranium or plutonium reprocessing plant .
In mid - 2002 , a Paris - based opposition group , the National Council of Resistance of Iran ( NCRI ) , revealed the existence of two previously unknown facilities -- a uranium enrichment facility at Natanz and a heavy water production plant at Arak .
Following the discovery of substantial reserves of uranium ore at Saghand , Yazd province , Iran announced that it was developing a nuclear power plan that would rely solely on indigenous resources .
These two events greatly alarmed the Western intelligence community .
An enrichment and heavy water production capability along with domestic resources of uranium would significantly contribute to the development of a closed nuclear fuel cycle in Iran .
Recent Developments and Current Status
Upon visiting suspected facilities in February 2003 , and with new declarations by Iran , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) concluded that several sensitive technology facilities are either operational , under construction , or planned .
The IAEA raised questions regarding possible enrichment activities at the workshops of the Kalaye Electric Company relating to production of centrifuge components .
Additionally , Iran admitted to having imported from China 1.8 tons of nuclear material ( UF6 , UF4 and UO2 ) used to manufacture uranium metal , which is essential in weapons production .
During its meetings with IAEA officials in August 2003 , Iran for the first time provided evidence of its technical violations of the NPT by revealing that in the 1990s , it had carried out 113 uranium conversion experiments involving the production of uranium metal from imported UF4 and the production of UF4 from imported UO2 , as well as laboratory - scale experiments in the 1980s involving the production of heavy water .
During the IAEA inspection in June 2003 , environmental samples that were taken from chemical traps of the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz revealed the presence of highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) .
Short of declaring Iran in violation of the NPT , the IAEA Director - General Mohamed ElBaradei stated , `` Iran has failed to meet its obligations under its Safeguards Agreement '' and criticized Iran for not being transparent with the construction of its nuclear - related facilities and import of nuclear material .
The IAEA Board of Governors has imposed on Iran a 31 October 2003 deadline to resolve all outstanding issues and to provide full and complete declaration of its nuclear material and nuclear activities , specifically Iran 's enrichment program and past conversion experiments .
It further called on Iran to suspend all enrichment activities and sign an Additional Protocol .
In an effort to diffuse the tense relations between Iran and the IAEA and to preserve the sanctity of the nonproliferation regime , foreign ministers of Britain , France and Germany secured Iran 's consent to cooperation with the IAEA ahead of the 31 October deadline .
Faced with probability of sanctions and international isolation in case of noncompliance with the IAEA 's demands , Iran announced on 21 October 2003 that it will cooperate with the IAEA with full transparency and disclosure , sign the Additional Protocol and commence its ratification procedures , and suspend all enrichment and reprocessing activities , albeit for an `` interim period . ''
And finally , on 18 December 2003 , Iran signed the Additional Protocol to the NPT , thus allowing snap inspections of its nuclear facilities by the IAEA experts .
Ali Akbar Salehi , the outgoing Iranian representative to the IAEA , signed on behalf of Iran , and Director - General ElBaradei signed for the IAEA .
Iran appears to be dangerously close to developing an indigenous nuclear fuel cycle , which would in turn enable it to develop a nuclear bomb without much reliance on outside help .
Comparison with the other nuclear axis member North Korea is tempting , but inappropriate .
Iran is motivated by its aspirations for political , religious , and military leadership in the region , unlike North Korea , for whom mere survival appears to be the priority .
Iran has traditionally felt insecure among its neighbors , first vis - a - vis Iraq , whom it considered its most immediate physical and ideological threat , and now that the Hussein regime is gone , the growing presence and influence of the United States .
Additionally , the constant threat of Israel 's nuclear arsenal , mostly perpetuated by Iran 's technocrats , government officials and the pro - nuclear lobby , adds to Iran 's perceived concerns and justifies it to the domestic audience the need to develop nuclear weapons .
Iran 's progress toward nuclear weapons , though irreversible , might be hampered by a combined effort on three fronts .
First , an unlikely but not impossible development would be an emergence of a domestic opposition to nuclear weapons , potentially within President Khatami 's reformist government .
A second front would come in the form of intense international pressure on states that are still in the position to help Iran perfect its knowledge and infrastructure -- Russia , Pakistan , China , and North Korea .
A third approach might be a regional effort on the part of Arab states to pressure Iran to abandon sensitive technology and questionable activities in favor of a weapons - free zone in the Middle East .
Since Iran signed the Additional Protocol on Nuclear Safeguards on 18 December 2003 , the Protocol provided inspectors from the IAEA with greater access within Iran and the option to carry out intrusive inspections at Iran 's nuclear facilities .
Subsequent IAEA inspections in Iran revealed a wealth of new information related to the development and scale of Iran 's nuclear program .
Iran is generally viewed as having been forthcoming and helpful to these IAEA efforts , although this cooperation has clearly not been absolute .
Indeed , on 18 June 2004 , IAEA board members voted to reprimand Iran for not providing the agency with more timely and comprehensive support .
Specifically , Iran was rebuked for postponing IAEA visits to a number of locations related to Iran 's P - 2 centrifuge enrichment program , which had been scheduled to take place in March 2004 .
The IAEA also criticized Iran 's lack of forthrightness about its possession of P - 2 design drawings and other related research , and information regarding its manufacturing and mechanical testing activities , all of which was omitted from Iran 's 21 October 2003 declaration to the agency .
The IAEA called on Iran to `` be proactive in taking all necessary steps on an urgent basis to resolve all outstanding issues '' , including those related to contamination by low - enriched uranium ( LEU ) and HEU , as well as the limited production of polonium - 210 and plutonium .
Concurrently , the United States along with some other IAEA board members has continued to maintain that Iran is pursuing an underground nuclear weapons program .
And while this claim has not yet been substantiated by IAEA inspectors , proponents argue that Iran has violated the NPT and that the country 's nuclear file should , in turn , be referred to the United Nations Security Council ( UNSC ) for its review .
El - Baradei is , however , weary of pursuing such a hard line against Iran , as he fears that exerting too much pressure may cause Iran to opt out of the NPT altogether .
Responding to the barrage of critics who insist that Iran 's illicit intentions are obvious , El - Baradei has pointed to the continued absence of a `` smoking gun '' and the fundamental shortcomings of attempts to concretely assess Iran 's programmatic goals without such evidence .
As he stated in July 2004 , `` We are not God .
We can not read intentions . ''
For its part , Iran continues to assert that it pursues a nuclear program with only peaceful applications , while El - Baradei is steadfast in his belief that the situation may be resolved diplomatically .
In addition , Russia remains unequivocally opposed to United Nations ' sanctions against Iran , especially given the absence of evidence to bolster claims about illicit activities .
Russia has also supported Iran 's disclosure efforts , despite Russian President Vladimir Putin 's November 2003 charge that Iran acted in bad faith by failing to fully comply with IAEA inspections .
Facilities
Overview
Iran is rapidly constructing nuclear facilities to achieve its goal of having an indigenous fuel cycle capability .
Iran 's nuclear program operates numerous facilities throughout the country , including the Nuclear Research Center in Tehran , ( TNRC ) , the Esfahan Nuclear Technology Center ( ENTC ) , Nuclear Research Center for Agriculture and Medicine , and the Beneficiation and Hydrometalurgical Research Center ( BHRC ) .
In addition to these , there have been new revelations about Iran 's centrifuge enrichment program located in Natanz and heavy water related activity in Arak .
Finally , the Bushehr nuclear reactor , when completed , will be Iran 's first nuclear power plant when it goes on - line in the coming year .
Within the next 10 years , there will likely be at least one , possibly more , power reactors built in Iran .
The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran ( AEOI ) is the government agency that oversees Iran 's nuclear program , and is one of the few agencies in Iran that reports directly to the president .
It was created in 1973 to oversee a 23,000 MW nuclear power program in Iran .
However , the organization has since undergone several revisions in mission and structure .
It is unclear how many people presently work at AEOI .
According to international observers of AEOI , the organization once had 4,500 employees .
After the Islamic Revolution , however , many leading nuclear scientists left the country , and in the 1990 , the AEOI reportedly employed `` around 200 scientists and 2,000 personnel engaged in nuclear research . ''
Research and development of the nuclear fuel cycle has been highlighted as a key function of the AEOI .
The organization consists of five separate divisions : Research , Nuclear Power Plant , Nuclear Fuel Production , Nuclear Regulatory Authority , and Planning , Education , and Parliamentary Affairs .
Two of these , Research and Fuel Production , are essential to develop a complete nuclear fuel cycle in Iran .
The responsibility of the Research Division is to plan and guide all nuclear - related research projects and to develop peaceful nuclear technologies in Iran .
It does so by coordinating activities of several nuclear research centers , most notably the TNRC and ENTC .
The TNRC operates , among other things , a 5 MW research reactor .
The ENTC is home to a miniature neutron source reactor ( MNSR ) , other research reactors , and subcritical assemblies .
The TNRC and ENTC manage various departments , facilities , and laboratories .
Over the years , these laboratories have conducted research into conversion ( a hexafluoride plant in Esfahan and at the Jabr Ibn Hayan Multipurpose Laboratories - JHL ) , enrichment , and reprocessing ( analysis and separation experiments using US - supplied hot cells , and radioisotope production at the TNRC ) .
The Nuclear Fuel Production Division ( NFPD ) of the AEOI is responsible for research and development of uranium exploration , mining , milling , conversion , fuel production , and waste management .
The NFPD maintains facilities in Yazd province to explore and exploit uranium deposits .
The Nuclear Fuel Research and Production Center in Esfahan houses various chemical , engineering , and metallurgical laboratories , the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor ( MNSR ) and the zero power reactor .
The Benefication and Hydrometallurgical Research Center ( BHRC ) operates facilities involved in the production of yellowcake .
AEOI 's activities and facilities have been tied to several universities .
Faculty from the Physics and Nuclear Science Department at Amir Kabir University in Tehran have worked closely with various AEOI components , including the Nuclear Fusion Department , the JHL laboratory , the Laser Research Center , the TNRC , and the Nuclear Power Plant Division .
Additionally , personnel from Saghand University cooperate with AEOI staff to conduct research in mining and milling of uranium at BHRC laboratories .
After numerous allegations by opposition groups and Western governments , Iran announced that it was constructing several new facilities .
The most important of these are the Natanz uranium enrichment plant ( comprising a pilot - and commercial - scale fuel enrichment facility ) , a fuel fabrication plant at Esfahan , a uranium metal purification and casting laboratory , and a 40 MW heavy water research reactor ( IR - 40 ) in Arak .
The presence of these facilities confirms Iran 's growing determination to achieve a full nuclear fuel cycle .
Iran claims that all its facilities are necessary for a peaceful and self - sufficient nuclear program .
However , analysts question the need for several components , particularly those in which the feedstock or product is either provided by a supplier country ( fuel production plant ) or that do not fit in the general scheme of Iran 's overall nuclear program ( uranium metal laboratory ) .
These facilities and Iran 's overall program are currently undergoing close scrutiny by the international community and will likely remain so until controversy over the facilities ' purpose and capability can be resolved .
Why ca n't we teach our children to read , write and reckon ?
It 's not that we do n't know how to , because we do .
It 's that we do n't want to .
And the reason we do n't want to is that effective education would require us to relinquish some cherished metaphysical beliefs about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular , as well as to violate some cherished vested interests .
These beliefs so dominate our educational establishment , our media , our politicians , and even our parents that it seems almost blasphemous to challenge them .
Here is an example .
If I were to ask a sample of American parents , `` Do you wish the elementary schools to encourage creativity in your children ? '' the near-unanimous answer would be , `` Yes , of course .
`` But what do we mean , specifically , by `` creativity '' ?
No one can say .
In practice , it ends up being equated with a `` self-expression '' that encourages the youngsters ' `` self-esteem .
`` The result is a generation of young people whose ignorance and intellectual incompetence is matched only by their good opinion of themselves .
The whole notion of `` creativity '' in education was ( and is ) part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against disciplined instruction , which was ( and is ) regarded as `` authoritarian , '' a repression and frustration of the latent talents and the wonderful , if as yet undefined , potentialities inherent in the souls of all our children .
It is not surprising that parents find this romantic extravagance so attractive .
Fortunately , these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood , and they have enough common sense to know what that demands .
Their commitment to `` creativity '' can not survive adolescent illiteracy .
American education 's future will be determined by the degree to which we -- all of us -- allow this common sense to prevail over the illusions that we also share .
The education establishment will fight against common sense every inch of the way .
The reasons are complex , but one simple reason ought not to be underestimated .
`` Progressive education '' ( as it was once called ) is far more interesting and agreeable to teachers than is disciplined instruction .
It is nice for teachers to think they are engaged in `` personality development '' and even nicer to minimize those irksome tests with often disappointing results .
It also provides teachers with a superior self-definition as a `` profession , '' since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy .
I myself took such courses in college , thinking I might end up a schoolteacher .
They could all fairly be described as `` pap '' courses .
But it is unfair to dump on teachers , as distinct from the educational establishment .
I know many schoolteachers and , on the whole , they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching .
They may not be among the `` best and brightest '' of their generation -- there are very few such people , by definition .
But they need not be to do their jobs well .
Yes , we all can remember one or two truly inspiring teachers from our school days .
But our education proceeded at the hands of those others , who were merely competent and conscientious .
In this sense , a teacher can be compared to one 's family doctor .
If he were brilliant , he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place .
If he is competent and conscientious , he serves us well .
Our teachers are not an important factor in our educational crisis .
Whether they are or are not underpaid is a problem of equity ; it is not an educational problem .
It is silly libel on our teachers to think they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more .
It is the kind of libel the teachers ' unions do n't mind spreading , for their own narrow purposes .
It is also the kind of libel politicians find useful , since it helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency .
But there is not one shred of evidence that , other things being equal , salary differentials result in educational differentials .
If there were such evidence , you can be sure you would have heard of it .
If we wish to be serious about American education , we know exactly what to do -- and , just as important , what not to do .
There are many successful schools scattered throughout this nation , some of them in the poorest of ghettos , and they are all sending us the same message .
Conversely , there are the majority of unsuccessful schools , and we know which efforts at educational reform are doomed beforehand .
We really do know all we need to know , if only we could assimilate this knowledge into our thinking .
In this respect , it would be helpful if our political leaders were mute , rather than eloquently `` concerned .
`` They are inevitably inclined to echo the conventional pap , since this is the least controversial option that is open to them .
Thus at the recent governors ' conference on education , Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas announced that `` this country needs a comprehensive child-development policy for children under five .
`` A comprehensive development policy for governors over 30 would seem to be a more pressing need .
What Gov. Clinton is advocating , in effect , is extending the educational system down to the pre-kindergarten years .
Whether desirable or not , this is a child-care program , not an educational program .
We know that very early exposure to schooling improves performance in the first grade , but afterward the difference is quickly washed away .
Let us sum up what we do know about education and about those education reforms that do work and do n't work : -- `` Parental involvement '' is a bad idea .
Parents are too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of their children .
Parents should be involved with their children 's education at home , not in school .
They should see to it that their kids do n't play truant ; they should make certain that the children spend enough time doing homework ; they should scrutinize the report card .
If parents are dissatisfied with a school , they should have the option of switching to another .
-- `` Community involvement '' is an even worse idea .
Here , the experience of New York City is decisive .
Locally elected school boards , especially in our larger cities , become the prey of ambitious , generally corrupt , and invariably demagogic local politicians or would-be politicians .
New York is in the process of trying to disengage itself from a 20-year-old commitment to this system of school governance , even as Chicago and other cities are moving to institute it .
-- In most states , increasing expenditures on education , in our current circumstances , will probably make things worse , not better .
The reason is simple : Education takes place in the classroom , where the influence of money is minimal .
Decades of educational research tell us unequivocally that even smaller classes have zero effect on the academic performance of the pupils -- though they may sometimes be desirable for other reasons .
The new money flows into the already top-heavy administrative structure , which busies itself piling more and more paper work on the teachers .
There is neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures ( in real terms ) have increased sharply in the past quarter-of-a-century -- we now spend more per pupil than any other country in the world -- educational performance has declined .
That is the way the system works .
-- Students should move up the educational ladder as their academic potential allows .
No student should be permitted to be graduated from elementary school without having mastered the 3 R 's at the level that prevailed 20 years ago .
This means `` tracking , '' whose main purpose is less to permit the gifted youngsters to flourish ( though that is clearly desirable ) than to ensure that the less gifted get the necessary grounding for further study or for entering the modern world of work .
The notion that tracking is somehow `` undemocratic '' is absurd .
The purpose of education is to encourage young men and women to realize their full academic potential .
No one in his right mind actually believes that we all have an equal academic potential .
-- It is generally desirable to use older textbooks -- many of them , alas , out of print -- rather than newer ones .
The latter are modish , trendy , often downright silly , and at best insubstantial .
They are based on dubious psychological and sociological theories rather than on educational experience .
One of the reasons American students do so poorly in math tests , as compared with British , French , German or Japanese students , is the influence of the `` New Math '' on American textbooks and teaching methods .
Anyone who wants to appreciate just how bizarre this situation is -- with students who ca n't add or subtract `` learning '' the conceptual basis of mathematical theory -- should read the article by Caleb Nelson ( himself a recent math major at Harvard ) in the November American Spectator .
-- Most important of all , schools should have principals with a large measure of authority over the faculty , the curriculum , and all matters of student discipline .
Study after study -- the most recent from the Brookings Institution -- tells us that the best schools are those that are free of outside interference and are governed by a powerful head .
With that authority , of course , goes an unambiguous accountability .
Schools that are structured in this way produce students with higher morale and superior academic performance .
This is a fact -- though , in view of all the feathers that are ruffled by this fact , it is not surprising that one hears so little about it .

Fire burns at Barangaroo construction site , Sydney , Australia
A large fire has started at the Barangaroo construction site overlooking Sydney Harbour , New South Wales , Australia .
The construction company said fire broke out at about 2:10pm local time ( 0310 UTC ) and appeared to have been caused by a welding accident in the basement of a building .
All site workers were evacuated without injury , according to Fire and Rescue NSW Superintendent Ian Krimmer .
Large clouds of smoke were continuing to pour out of the building , casting a thick pall of smoke over the city skyline .
Some nearby buildings have also been evacuated , including the KPMG building and offices of the Macquarie Bank .

California wildfire forces evacuation of thousands
At least 400 homes have been evacuated in Sierra Madre near Los Angeles , California after a wildfire which started on Saturday , began to threaten their homes .
So far only five percent of the 350 acre fire is contained , with over 400 firefighters battling the blaze .
Authorities say that it has been over 40 years since some parts of the land have caught fire .
The cause of the fire is not known .
Authorities say the investigation into how it started may take up to three days to finish .
So far there have been no injuries and no homes have yet been damaged , but one building storing equipment used by firefighters was burned to the ground .
For a short time , at least 100 hikers were trapped in the mountains and a boy scout camp was also threatened by the blaze .
Several people celebrating a wedding have also been trapped by the fire but are not injured and authorities say they are in no danger from the blaze .
However , there are currently around 1000 people under mandatory evacuations , and the city has been declared in a state of emergency .
It could take at least five days before the fire can be brought under full control .
Large forest fire continues to burn into third day in southern Norway
A large forest fire that started on Monday, June 9 is still out of control in the municipality of Froland in southern Norway .
The fire is the largest forest fire to occur in Norway since World War II .
The fire has spread extensively and it is estimated that approximately 2,500 acres of forest have been damaged .
Approximately 15 cabins are reported to have burned to the ground , but as of yet , no permanent dwellings or farms have been damaged .
However , many inhabitants have been evacuated due to the fire threatening their homes , including the entire villages of Mykland and Belland .
There have also been some power outages due to power lines being damaged .
Approximately 140 persons , including fire-fighters from several fire departments , and personnel from the Civil Defence and the Home Guard are working to curtail the fire .
Four fire helicopters have been deployed .
The fire fighting is focused on areas where the fire threatens buildings .
Extremely dry weather , and difficult wind conditions , have caused severe difficulties in fighting the fire .
Fire-fighters first had hope of gaining control on the morning of Thursday , June 12 , but the wind changed direction during the day , causing a large extension of the fire .
There is some hope that the weekend will bring some rain ; however , this will likely not be enough to stop the fire .
It could take several weeks before the fire is completely extinguished .

Harry_Reed : This investigation has been stymied stopped , obstructions thrown up every step of the way .
That 's the real slap in the face .
That 's the slap in the face .
And today the American people are going to see a little bit of light .
Ed_Henry : What 's really going on is Democrats feel emboldened by the indictment of Vice President Cheney 's former chief of staff believing this is their chance to issue a broader indictment of the Bush administration .
Harry_Reed : We have lost over two thousand of our best and bravest .
Over fifteen thousand have been seriously wounded .
We are spending more than six million dollars a month with no end in sight .
And this Republican led Senate intelligence committee refuses to even ask the hard questions about the misinformation -
Ed_Henry : Republicans insist they 're completing the investigation .
And this is just a distraction .
Bill_Frist : This is purely political .
This is settling settling an old political score .
Ed_Henry : Democrats say they also want to signal they 're ready to stand up to the Republican majority and may even filibuster the president 's latest Supreme Court pick Samuel Alito a move that would make these events seem like the opening fireworks in a much nastier battle .
Ed_Henry : Ed Henry ~ CNN Capitol Hill .
Paula_Zahn : So do you think we just saw the outlines to what the midterm election battlelines might look like ?
A debate that 's likely to rage on for many many months to come .
Paula_Zahn : Turning our attention now to something that has a lot of folks concerned .
You 've been hearing an awful lot about avian or bird flu .
The most common and deadly form has already spread in birds from South Asia to Europe .
Paula_Zahn : And now there is real concern that the virus could mutate and become devastating to humans .
In fact some health experts say it 's just a matter of time .
Paula_Zahn : Today President Bush unveiled a seven point one billion dollar plan to prepare for a possible flu pandemic .
Paula_Zahn : Now much of that money would go toward stockpiling enough vaccine to protect twenty million healthcare workers and other first responders .
Paula_Zahn : Speeding up production of vaccines and buying the anti-viral drugs ( ( Tamoflu ) ) and ( ( Rolenzo ) ) which in some cases prevent flu infection .
Paula_Zahn : And we now turn to senior medical correspondent Dr . Sanjay Gupto who has just gotten back from South Asia .
Paula_Zahn : Where bird flu has in the past two years killed at least sixty-two people .
Paula_Zahn : About half of those who were struck with it .
Hundreds of millions of birds around the world have been destroyed to try to contain the disease .
Paula_Zahn : And Dr . Gupto now just joins us from the Emory University hospital in Atlanta .
Always good to see you doctor .
So -
Dr _Gupto : Thanks .
Paula_Zahn : I know you 've had a chance to study the the plan the president put forth today .
Does it go far enough in your estimation ?
Dr _Gupto : You know what 's sort of interesting Paula .
On one hand it is it is remarkable that the president is devoting as much time and as much money uh all towards a disease that does n't exist yet .
Pandemic flu does n't exist yet .
Dr _Gupto : But a lot of people are talking about it .
And I think that 's remarkable to a lot of people who are eh who are citizens and a lot of people in the public health community as well .
Dr _Gupto : On the other hand to be able to outline and do the thing that were talked about today to basically completely revamp the public health system so that local officials can talk to state officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of bird flu happens that takes probably a lot more money and a and a really a complete revamping of our public health systems .
Dr _Gupto : The other thing Paula really important is that they talk a lot about the fact that our- we 're a lot better at taking care of patients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of ICUs a lot of ICUs in the hospital behind me that can take care of critically ill patients .
Dr _Gupto : The problem though at any given time eighty to ninety percent of those ICU rooms are full so we just do n't have the surge capacity and that 's going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic Paula .
Paula_Zahn : Uh let 's talk about the other ( ( problem ) ) of the plan where the president will spend uh or wants to spend a billion dollars to stockpile antiviral medicine like ( ( Tamaflu ) ) and ( ( Rolenza ) ) .
Do we even know if these two medications are going to be effective against a strain that has n't even presented itself ?
Dr _Gupto : Here here 's the important thing about that .
We do n't know for sure .
A lot of people focusing a lot of energy on ( ( Tamaflu ) ) and ( ( Rolenza ) ) .
These are antiviral drugs .
They are not vaccines .
They are antiviral drugs uh designed to basically shorten uh how bad the flu might effect you uh try to lessen its impact .
Dr _Gupto : But we only know that it might work because of laboratory studies and animal studies uh uh in particular .
The way to really study it would be to knowingly expose people to bird flu .
And nobody will actually ever do that study for obvious reasons .
Dr _Gupto : So it 's just theoretical really for the most part that those will work Paula .
Paula_Zahn : Dr . Sanjay Gupto thanks for the update .
By the way are you catching a cold ?
Dr _Gupto : A a little bit .
You know I just got back .
And the ninteen hour plane ride .
Not bird flu though .
I can assure you that Paula .
Paula_Zahn : Chicken soup .
Dr _Gupto : That 's right .
Just what the doctor ordered .
Paula_Zahn : Works all the time .
Yeah right .
I made a free house call for you doctor .
Coming up on News Night Tonight , cooking a turkey is fine. ( ( Appearing ) ) in one is n't .
'' WE HAVE SOME PLANES ''
Tuesday, September 11, 2001 , dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern United States .
Millions of men and women readied themselves for work .
Some made their way to the Twin Towers , the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City .
Others went to Arlington , Virginia , to the Pentagon .
Across the Potomac River , the United States Congress was back in session .
At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue , people began to line up for a White House tour .
In Sarasota , Florida , President George W. Bush went for an early morning run .
For those heading to an airport , weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey .
Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari , who arrived at the airport in Portland , Maine .
INSIDE THE FOUR FLIGHTS
Boarding the Flights
Boston : American 11 and United 175 .
Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston 's Logan International Airport .
When he checked in for his flight to Boston , Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS ( Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System ) , created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures .
Under security rules in place at the time , the only consequence of Atta 's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft .
This did not hinder Atta 's plans .
Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45 .
Seven minutes later , Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi , a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport .
They spoke for three minutes .
It would be their final conversation .
Between 6:45 and 7:40 , Atta and Omari , along with Satam al Suqami , Wail al Shehri , and Waleed al Shehri , checked in and boarded American Airlines Flight 11 , bound for Los Angeles .
The flight was scheduled to depart at 7:45 .
In another Logan terminal , Shehhi , joined by Fayez Banihammad , Mohand al Shehri , Ahmed al Ghamdi , and Hamza al Ghamdi , checked in for United Airlines Flight 175 , also bound for Los Angeles .
A couple of Shehhi 's colleagues were obviously unused to travel ; according to the United ticket agent , they had trouble understanding the standard security questions , and she had to go over them slowly until they gave the routine , reassuring answers .
Their flight was scheduled to depart at 8:00 .
The security checkpoints through which passengers , including Atta and his colleagues , gained access to the American 11 gate were operated by Globe Security under a contract with American Airlines .
In a different terminal , the single checkpoint through which passengers for United 175 passed was controlled by United Airlines , which had contracted with Huntleigh USA to perform the screening .
In passing through these checkpoints , each of the hijackers would have been screened by a walk-through metal detector calibrated to detect items with at least the metal content of a .22-caliber handgun .
Anyone who might have set off that detector would have been screened with a hand wand-a procedure requiring the screener to identify the metal item or items that caused the alarm .
In addition , an X-ray machine would have screened the hijackers ' carry-on belongings .
The screening was in place to identify and confiscate weapons and other items prohibited from being carried onto a commercial flight .
None of the checkpoint supervisors recalled the hijackers or reported anything suspicious regarding their screening .
While Atta had been selected by CAPPS in Portland , three members of his hijacking team-Suqami , Wail al Shehri , and Waleed al Shehri -were selected in Boston .
Their selection affected only the handling of their checked bags , not their screening at the checkpoint .
All five men cleared the checkpoint and made their way to the gate for American 11 .
Atta , Omari , and Suqami took their seats in business class ( seats 8D , 8G , and 10B , respectively ) .
The Shehri brothers had adjacent seats in row 2 ( Wail in 2A , Waleed in 2B ) , in the firstclass cabin .
They boarded American 11 between 7:31 and 7:40 .
The aircraft pushed back from the gate at 7:40 .
Shehhi and his team , none of whom had been selected by CAPPS , boarded United 175 between 7:23 and 7:28 ( Banihammad in 2A , Shehri in 2B , Shehhi in 6C , Hamza al Ghamdi in 9C , and Ahmed al Ghamdi in 9D ) .
Their aircraft pushed back from the gate just before 8:00 .
Washington Dulles : American 77 .
Hundreds of miles southwest of Boston , at Dulles International Airport in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C. , five more men were preparing to take their early morning flight .
At 7:15 , a pair of them , Khalid al Mihdhar and Majed Moqed , checked in at the American Airlines ticket counter for Flight 77 , bound for Los Angeles .
Within the next 20 minutes , they would be followed by Hani Hanjour and two brothers , Nawaf al Hazmi and Salem al Hazmi .
Hani Hanjour , Khalid al Mihdhar , and Majed Moqed were flagged by CAPPS .
The Hazmi brothers were also selected for extra scrutiny by the airline 's customer service representative at the check-in counter .
He did so because one of the brothers did not have photo identification nor could he understand English , and because the agent found both of the passengers to be suspicious .
The only consequence of their selection was that their checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that they had boarded the aircraft .
All five hijackers passed through the Main Terminal 's west security screening checkpoint ; United Airlines , which was the responsible air carrier , had contracted out the work to Argenbright Security .
The checkpoint featured closed-circuit television that recorded all passengers , including the hijackers , as they were screened .
At 7:18 , Mihdhar and Moqed entered the security checkpoint .
Mihdhar and Moqed placed their carry-on bags on the belt of the X-ray machine and proceeded through the first metal detector .
Both set off the alarm , and they were directed to a second metal detector .
Mihdhar did not trigger the alarm and was permitted through the checkpoint .
After Moqed set it off , a screener wanded him .
He passed this inspection .
About 20 minutes later , at 7:35 , another passenger for Flight 77 , Hani Hanjour , placed two carry-on bags on the X-ray belt in the Main Terminal 's west checkpoint , and proceeded , without alarm , through the metal detector .
A short time later , Nawaf and Salem al Hazmi entered the same checkpoint .
Salem al Hazmi cleared the metal detector and was permitted through ; Nawaf al Hazmi set off the alarms for both the first and second metal detectors and was then hand-wanded before being passed .
In addition , his over-the-shoulder carry-on bag was swiped by an explosive trace detector and then passed .
The video footage indicates that he was carrying an unidentified item in his back pocket , clipped to its rim .
When the local civil aviation security office of the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) later investigated these security screening operations , the screeners recalled nothing out of the ordinary .
They could not recall that any of the passengers they screened were CAPPS selectees .
We asked a screening expert to review the videotape of the hand-wanding , and he found the quality of the screener 's work to have been `` marginal at best . ''
The screener should have `` resolved '' what set off the alarm ; and in the case of both Moqed and Hazmi , it was clear that he did not .
At 7:50 , Majed Moqed and Khalid al Mihdhar boarded the flight and were seated in 12A and 12B in coach .
Hani Hanjour , assigned to seat 1B ( first class ) , soon followed .
The Hazmi brothers , sitting in 5E and 5F , joined Hanjour in the first-class cabin .
Newark : United 93 .
Between 7:03 and 7:39 , Saeed al Ghamdi , Ahmed al Nami , Ahmad al Haznawi , and Ziad Jarrah checked in at the United Airlines ticket counter for Flight 93 , going to Los Angeles .
Two checked bags ; two did not .
Haznawi was selected by CAPPS .
His checked bag was screened for explosives and then loaded on the plane .
The four men passed through the security checkpoint , owned by United Airlines and operated under contract by Argenbright Security .
Like the checkpoints in Boston , it lacked closed-circuit television surveillance so there is no documentary evidence to indicate when the hijackers passed through the checkpoint , what alarms may have been triggered , or what security procedures were administered .
The FAA interviewed the screeners later ; none recalled anything unusual or suspicious .
The four men boarded the plane between 7:39 and 7:48 .
All four had seats in the first-class cabin ; their plane had no business-class section .
Jarrah was in seat 1B , closest to the cockpit ; Nami was in 3C , Ghamdi in 3D , and Haznawi in 6B .
The 19 men were aboard four transcontinental flights .
They were planning to hijack these planes and turn them into large guided missiles , loaded with up to 11,400 gallons of jet fuel .
By 8:00 A.M. on the morning of Tuesday, September 11,2001 , they had defeated all the security layers that America 's civil aviation security system then had in place to prevent a hijacking .
The Hijacking of American 11 American Airlines Flight 11 provided nonstop service from Boston to Los Angeles .
On September 11 , Captain John Ogonowski and First Officer Thomas McGuinness piloted the Boeing 767 .
It carried its full capacity of nine flight attendants .
Eighty-one passengers boarded the flight with them ( including the five terrorists ) .22 The plane took off at 7:59 .
Just before 8:14 , it had climbed to 26,000 feet , not quite its initial assigned cruising altitude of 29,000 feet .
All communications and flight profile data were normal .
About this time the `` Fasten Seatbelt '' sign would usually have been turned off and the flight attendants would have begun preparing for cabin service .
At that same time , American 11 had its last routine communication with the ground when it acknowledged navigational instructions from the FAA 's air traffic control ( ATC ) center in Boston .
Sixteen seconds after that transmission , ATC instructed the aircraft 's pilots to climb to 35,000 feet .
That message and all subsequent attempts to contact the flight were not acknowledged .
From this and other evidence , we believe the hijacking began at 8:14 or shortly thereafter .
Reports from two flight attendants in the coach cabin , Betty Ong and Madeline `` Amy ''
Sweeney , tell us most of what we know about how the hijacking happened .
As it began , some of the hijackers-most likely Wail al Shehri and Waleed al Shehri , who were seated in row 2 in first class-stabbed the two unarmed flight attendants who would have been preparing for cabin service .
We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit ; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight .
Ong speculated that they had `` jammed their way '' in .
Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key , to force one of them to open the cockpit door , or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit .
Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way .
At the same time or shortly thereafter , Atta -the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat , possibly accompanied by Omari .
As this was happening , passenger Daniel Lewin , who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari , was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami , who was seated directly behind Lewin .
Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military .
He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him , not realizing that another was sitting behind him .
The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace , pepper spray , or some other irritant in the first-class cabin , in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane .
They claimed they had a bomb .
About five minutes after the hijacking began , Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary , North Carolina , via an ATT airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight .
This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training , which emphasized that in a hijacking , they were to communicate with the cockpit crew .
The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes , as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground .
At 8:19 , Ong reported: '' The cockpit is not answering , somebody 's stabbed in business class-and I think there 's Mace-that we ca n't breathe-I do n't know , I think we 're getting hijacked . ''
She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants .
At 8:21 , one of the American employees receiving Ong 's call in North Carolina , Nydia Gonzalez , alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth , Texas , reaching Craig Marquis , the manager on duty .
Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline 's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit .
At 8:23 , the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft .
Six minutes later , the air traffic control specialist in American 's operations center contacted the FAA 's Boston Air Traffic Control Center about the flight .
The center was already aware of the problem .
Boston Center knew of a problem on the flight in part because just before 8:25 the hijackers had attempted to communicate with the passengers .
The microphone was keyed , and immediately one of the hijackers said , `` Nobody move .
Everything will be okay .
If you try to make any moves , you 'll endanger yourself and the airplane .
Just stay quiet . ''
Air traffic controllers heard the transmission ; Ong did not .
The hijackers probably did not know how to operate the cockpit radio communication system correctly , and thus inadvertently broadcast their message over the air traffic control channel instead of the cabin public-address channel .
Also at 8:25 , and again at 8:29 , Amy Sweeney got through to the American Flight Services Office in Boston but was cut off after she reported someone was hurt aboard the flight .
Three minutes later , Sweeney was reconnected to the office and began relaying updates to the manager , Michael Woodward .
At 8:26 , Ong reported that the plane was `` flying erratically . ''
A minute later , Flight 11 turned south .
American also began getting identifications of the hijackers , as Ong and then Sweeney passed on some of the seat numbers of those who had gained unauthorized access to the cockpit .
Sweeney calmly reported on her line that the plane had been hijacked ; a man in first class had his throat slashed ; two flight attendants had been stabbed-one was seriously hurt and was on oxygen while the other 's wounds seemed minor ; a doctor had been requested ; the flight attendants were unable to contact the cockpit ; and there was a bomb in the cockpit .
Sweeney told Woodward that she and Ong were trying to relay as much information as they could to people on the ground .
At 8:38 , Ong told Gonzalez that the plane was flying erratically again .
Around this time Sweeney told Woodward that the hijackers were Middle Easterners , naming three of their seat numbers .
One spoke very little English and one spoke excellent English .
The hijackers had gained entry to the cockpit , and she did not know how .
The aircraft was in a rapid descent .
At 8:41 , Sweeney told Woodward that passengers in coach were under the impression that there was a routine medical emergency in first class .
Other flight attendants were busy at duties such as getting medical supplies while Ong and Sweeney were reporting the events .
At 8:41 , in American 's operations center , a colleague told Marquis that the air traffic controllers declared Flight 11 a hijacking and `` think he 's [ American 11 ] headed toward Kennedy [ airport in New York City ] .
They 're moving everybody out of the way .
They seem to have him on a primary radar .
They seem to think that he is descending . ''
At 8:44 , Gonzalez reported losing phone contact with Ong .
About this same time Sweeney reported to Woodward , `` Something is wrong .
We are in a rapid descent . . . we are all over the place . ''
Woodward asked Sweeney to look out the window to see if she could determine where they were .
Sweeney responded: '' We are flying low .
We are flying very , very low .
We are flying way too low . ''
Seconds later she said , '' Oh my God we are way too low . ''
The phone call ended .
At 8:46:40 , American 11 crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City .
All on board , along with an unknown number of people in the tower , were killed instantly .
The Hijacking of United 175 United Airlines Flight 175 was scheduled to depart for Los Angeles at 8:00 .
Captain Victor Saracini and First Officer Michael Horrocks piloted the Boeing 767 , which had seven flight attendants .
Fifty-six passengers boarded the flight .
United 175 pushed back from its gate at 7:58 and departed Logan Airport at 8:14 .
By 8:33 , it had reached its assigned cruising altitude of 31,000 feet .
The flight attendants would have begun their cabin service .
The flight had taken off just as American 11 was being hijacked , and at 8:42 the United 175 flight crew completed their report on a `` suspicious transmission '' overheard from another plane ( which turned out to have been Flight 11 ) just after takeoff .
This was United 175 's last communication with the ground .
The hijackers attacked sometime between 8:42 and 8:46 .
They used knives ( as reported by two passengers and a flight attendant ) , Mace ( reported by one passenger ) , and the threat of a bomb ( reported by the same passenger ) .
They stabbed members of the flight crew ( reported by a flight attendant and one passenger ) .
Both pilots had been killed ( reported by one flight attendant ) .
The eyewitness accounts came from calls made from the rear of the plane , from passengers originally seated further forward in the cabin , a sign that passengers and perhaps crew had been moved to the back of the aircraft .
Given similarities to American 11 in hijacker seating and in eyewitness reports of tactics and weapons , as well as the contact between the presumed team leaders , Atta and Shehhi , we believe the tactics were similar on both flights .
The first operational evidence that something was abnormal on United 175 came at 8:47 , when the aircraft changed beacon codes twice within a minute .
At 8:51 , the flight deviated from its assigned altitude , and a minute later New York air traffic controllers began repeatedly and unsuccessfully trying to contact it .
At 8:52 , in Easton , Connecticut , a man named Lee Hanson received a phone call from his son Peter , a passenger on United 175 .
His son told him : `` I think they 've taken over the cockpit-An attendant has been stabbed- and someone else up front may have been killed .
The plane is making strange moves .
Call United Airlines -Tell them it 's Flight 175 , Boston to LA. ''
Lee Hanson then called the Easton Police Department and relayed what he had heard .
Also at 8:52 , a male flight attendant called a United office in San Francisco , reaching Marc Policastro .
The flight attendant reported that the flight had been hijacked , both pilots had been killed , a flight attendant had been stabbed , and the hijackers were probably flying the plane .
The call lasted about two minutes , after which Policastro and a colleague tried unsuccessfully to contact the flight .
At 8:58 , the flight took a heading toward New York City .
At 8:59 , Flight 175 passenger Brian David Sweeney tried to call his wife , Julie .
He left a message on their home answering machine that the plane had been hijacked .
He then called his mother , Louise Sweeney , told her the flight had been hijacked , and added that the passengers were thinking about storming the cockpit to take control of the plane away from the hijackers .
At 9:00 , Lee Hanson received a second call from his son Peter : It 's getting bad , Dad-A stewardess was stabbed-They seem to have knives and Mace-They said they have a bomb-It 's getting very bad on the plane-Passengers are throwing up and getting sick-The plane is making jerky movements-I do n't think the pilot is flying the plane-I think we are going down-I think they intend to go to Chicago or someplace and fly into a building-Do n't worry , Dad- If it happens , it 'll be very fast-My God , my God .
The call ended abruptly .
Lee Hanson had heard a woman scream just before it cut off .
He turned on a television , and in her home so did Louise Sweeney .
Both then saw the second aircraft hit the World Trade Center .
At 9:03:11 , United Airlines Flight 175 struck the South Tower of the World Trade Center .
All on board , along with an unknown number of people in the tower , were killed instantly .
The Hijacking of American 77 American Airlines Flight 77 was scheduled to depart from Washington Dulles for Los Angeles at 8:10 .
The aircraft was a Boeing 757 piloted by Captain Charles F. Burlingame and First Officer David Charlebois .
There were four flight attendants .
On September 11 , the flight carried 58 passengers .
American 77 pushed back from its gate at 8:09 and took off at 8:20 .
At 8:46 , the flight reached its assigned cruising altitude of 35,000 feet .
Cabin service would have begun .
At 8:51 , American 77 transmitted its last routine radio communication .
The hijacking began between 8:51 and 8:54 .
As on American 11 and United 175 , the hijackers used knives ( reported by one passenger ) and moved all the passengers ( and possibly crew ) to the rear of the aircraft ( reported by one flight attendant and one passenger ) .
Unlike the earlier flights , the Flight 77 hijackers were reported by a passenger to have box cutters .
Finally , a passenger reported that an announcement had been made by the `` pilot '' that the plane had been hijacked .
Neither of the firsthand accounts mentioned any stabbings or the threat or use of either a bomb or Mace , though both witnesses began the flight in the first-class cabin .
At 8:54 , the aircraft deviated from its assigned course , turning south .
Two minutes later the transponder was turned off and even primary radar contact with the aircraft was lost .
The Indianapolis Air Traffic Control Center repeatedly tried and failed to contact the aircraft .
American Airlines dispatchers also tried , without success .
At 9:00 , American Airlines Executive Vice President Gerard Arpey learned that communications had been lost with American 77 .
This was now the second American aircraft in trouble .
He ordered all American Airlines flights in the Northeast that had not taken off to remain on the ground .
Shortly before 9:10 , suspecting that American 77 had been hijacked , American headquarters concluded that the second aircraft to hit the World Trade Center might have been Flight 77 .
After learning that United Airlines was missing a plane , American Airlines headquarters extended the ground stop nationwide .
At 9:12 , Renee May called her mother , Nancy May , in Las Vegas .
She said her flight was being hijacked by six individuals who had moved them to the rear of the plane .
She asked her mother to alert American Airlines .
Nancy May and her husband promptly did so .
At some point between 9:16 and 9:26 , Barbara Olson called her husband , Ted Olson , the solicitor general of the United States .
She reported that the flight had been hijacked , and the hijackers had knives and box cutters .
She further indicated that the hijackers were not aware of her phone call , and that they had put all the passengers in the back of the plane .
About a minute into the conversation , the call was cut off .
Solicitor General Olson tried unsuccessfully to reach Attorney General John Ashcroft .
Shortly after the first call , Barbara Olson reached her husband again .
She reported that the pilot had announced that the flight had been hijacked , and she asked her husband what she should tell the captain to do .
Ted Olson asked for her location and she replied that the aircraft was then flying over houses .
Another passenger told her they were traveling northeast .
The Solicitor General then informed his wife of the two previous hijackings and crashes .
She did not display signs of panic and did not indicate any awareness of an impending crash .
At that point , the second call was cut off .
At 9:29 , the autopilot on American 77 was disengaged ; the aircraft was at 7,000 feet and approximately 38 miles west of the Pentagon .
At 9:32 , controllers at the Dulles Terminal Radar Approach Control `` observed a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed . ''
This was later determined to have been Flight 77 .
At 9:34 , Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport advised the Secret Service of an unknown aircraft heading in the direction of the White House .
American 77 was then 5 miles west-southwest of the Pentagon and began a 330-degree turn .
At the end of the turn , it was descending through 2,200 feet , pointed toward the Pentagon and downtown Washington .
The hijacker pilot then advanced the throttles to maximum power and dove toward the Pentagon .
At 9:37:46 , American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon , traveling at approximately 530 miles per hour .
All on board , as well as many civilian and military personnel in the building , were killed .
The Battle for United 93 At 8:42 , United Airlines Flight 93 took off from Newark ( New Jersey ) Liberty International Airport bound for San Francisco .
The aircraft was piloted by Captain Jason Dahl and First Officer Leroy Homer , and there were five flight attendants .
Thirty-seven passengers , including the hijackers , boarded the plane .
Scheduled to depart the gate at 8:00 , the Boeing 757 's takeoff was delayed because of the airport 's typically heavy morning traffic .
The hijackers had planned to take flights scheduled to depart at 7:45 ( American 11 ) , 8:00 ( United 175 and United 93 ) , and 8:10 ( American 77 ) .
Three of the flights had actually taken off within 10 to 15 minutes of their planned departure times .
United 93 would ordinarily have taken off about 15 minutes after pulling away from the gate .
When it left the ground at 8:42 , the flight was running more than 25 minutes late .
As United 93 left Newark , the flight 's crew members were unaware of the hijacking of American 11 .
Around 9:00 , the FAA , American , and United were facing the staggering realization of apparent multiple hijackings .
At 9:03 , they would see another aircraft strike the World Trade Center .
Crisis managers at the FAA and the airlines did not yet act to warn other aircraft .
At the same time , Boston Center realized that a message transmitted just before 8:25 by the hijacker pilot of American 11 included the phrase , `` We have some planes . ''
No one at the FAA or the airlines that day had ever dealt with multiple hijackings .
Such a plot had not been carried out anywhere in the world in more than 30 years , and never in the United States .
As news of the hijackings filtered through the FAA and the airlines , it does not seem to have occurred to their leadership that they needed to alert other aircraft in the air that they too might be at risk .
United 175 was hijacked between 8:42 and 8:46 , and awareness of that hijacking began to spread after 8:51 .
American 77 was hijacked between 8:51 and 8:54 .
By 9:00 , FAA and airline officials began to comprehend that attackers were going after multiple aircraft .
American Airlines ' nationwide ground stop between 9:05 and 9:10 was followed by a United Airlines ground stop .
FAA controllers at Boston Center , which had tracked the first two hijackings , requested at 9:07 that Herndon Command Center `` get messages to airborne aircraft to increase security for the cockpit . ''
There is no evidence that Herndon took such action .
Boston Center immediately began speculating about other aircraft that might be in danger , leading them to worry about a transcontinental flight- Delta 1989-that in fact was not hijacked .
At 9:19 , the FAA 's New England regional office called Herndon and asked that Cleveland Center advise Delta 1989 to use extra cockpit security .
Several FAA air traffic control officials told us it was the air carriers ' responsibility to notify their planes of security problems .
One senior FAA air traffic control manager said that it was simply not the FAA 's place to order the airlines what to tell their pilots .
We believe such statements do not reflect an adequate appreciation of the FAA 's responsibility for the safety and security of civil aviation .
The airlines bore responsibility , too .
They were facing an escalating number of conflicting and , for the most part , erroneous reports about other flights , as well as a continuing lack of vital information from the FAA about the hijacked flights .
We found no evidence , however , that American Airlines sent any cockpit warnings to its aircraft on 9/11 .
United 's first decisive action to notify its airborne aircraft to take defensive action did not come until 9:19 , when a United flight dispatcher , Ed Ballinger , took the initiative to begin transmitting warnings to his 16 transcontinental flights : `` Beware any cockpit intrusion- Two a/c [ aircraft ] hit World Trade Center . ''
One of the flights that received the warning was United 93 .
Because Ballinger was still responsible for his other flights as well as Flight 175 , his warning message was not transmitted to Flight 93 until 9:23 .
By all accounts , the first 46 minutes of Flight 93 's cross-country trip proceeded routinely .
Radio communications from the plane were normal .
Heading , speed , and altitude ran according to plan .
At 9:24 , Ballinger 's warning to United 93 was received in the cockpit .
Within two minutes , at 9:26 , the pilot , Jason Dahl , responded with a note of puzzlement : `` Ed , confirm latest mssg plz- Jason . ''
The hijackers attacked at 9:28 .
While traveling 35,000 feet above eastern Ohio , United 93 suddenly dropped 700 feet .
Eleven seconds into the descent , the FAA 's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft .
During the first broadcast , the captain or first officer could be heard declaring `` Mayday '' amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit .
The second radio transmission , 35 seconds later , indicated that the fight was continuing .
The captain or first officer could be heard shouting: '' Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here . ''
On the morning of 9/11 , there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers .
This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001 .
But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation .
The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams .
They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff .
On Flight 93 , however , the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers .
The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight , Mohamed al Kahtani , had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida 's Orlando International Airport in August .
Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane , not four , some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight .
FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals , usually air carrier or FAA personnel .
We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers , or anyone else , sat there on this flight .
All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class , and they seem to have used them .
We believe it is more likely that Jarrah , the crucial pilot-trained member of their team , remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized ; and once inside , he would not have been visible to the passengers .
At 9:32 , a hijacker , probably Jarrah , made or attempted to make the following announcement to the passengers of Flight 93 : '' Ladies and Gentlemen : Here the captain , please sit down keep remaining sitting .
We have a bomb on board .
So , sit . ''
The flight data recorder ( also recovered ) indicates that Jarrah then instructed the plane 's autopilot to turn the aircraft around and head east .
The cockpit voice recorder data indicate that a woman , most likely a flight attendant , was being held captive in the cockpit .
She struggled with one of the hijackers who killed or otherwise silenced her .
Shortly thereafter , the passengers and flight crew began a series of calls from GTE airphones and cellular phones .
These calls between family , friends , and colleagues took place until the end of the flight and provided those on the ground with firsthand accounts .
They enabled the passengers to gain critical information , including the news that two aircraft had slammed into the World Trade Center .
At 9:39 , the FAA 's Cleveland Air Route Traffic Control Center overheard a second announcement indicating that there was a bomb on board , that the plane was returning to the airport , and that they should remain seated .
While it apparently was not heard by the passengers , this announcement , like those on Flight 11 and Flight 77 , was intended to deceive them .
Jarrah , like Atta earlier , may have inadvertently broadcast the message because he did not know how to operate the radio and the intercom .
To our knowledge none of them had ever flown an actual airliner before .
At least two callers from the flight reported that the hijackers knew that passengers were making calls but did not seem to care .
It is quite possible Jarrah knew of the success of the assault on the World Trade Center .
He could have learned of this from messages being sent by United Airlines to the cockpits of its transcontinental flights , including Flight 93 , warning of cockpit intrusion and telling of the New York attacks .
But even without them , he would certainly have understood that the attacks on the World Trade Center would already have unfolded , given Flight 93 's tardy departure from Newark .
If Jarrah did know that the passengers were making calls , it might not have occurred to him that they were certain to learn what had happened in New York , thereby defeating his attempts at deception .
At least ten passengers and two crew members shared vital information with family , friends , colleagues , or others on the ground .
All understood the plane had been hijacked .
They said the hijackers wielded knives and claimed to have a bomb .
The hijackers were wearing red bandanas , and they forced the passengers to the back of the aircraft .
Callers reported that a passenger had been stabbed and that two people were lying on the floor of the cabin , injured or dead-possibly the captain and first officer .
One caller reported that a flight attendant had been killed .
One of the callers from United 93 also reported that he thought the hijackers might possess a gun .
But none of the other callers reported the presence of a firearm .
One recipient of a call from the aircraft recounted specifically asking her caller whether the hijackers had guns .
The passenger replied that he did not see one .
No evidence of firearms or of their identifiable remains was found at the aircraft 's crash site , and the cockpit voice recorder gives no indication of a gun being fired or mentioned at any time .
We believe that if the hijackers had possessed a gun , they would have used it in the flight 's last minutes as the passengers fought back .
Passengers on three flights reported the hijackers ' claim of having a bomb .
The FBI told us they found no trace of explosives at the crash sites .
One of the passengers who mentioned a bomb expressed his belief that it was not real .
Lacking any evidence that the hijackers attempted to smuggle such illegal items past the security screening checkpoints , we believe the bombs were probably fake .
During at least five of the passengers ' phone calls , information was shared about the attacks that had occurred earlier that morning at the World Trade Center .
Five calls described the intent of passengers and surviving crew members to revolt against the hijackers .
According to one call , they voted on whether to rush the terrorists in an attempt to retake the plane .
They decided , and acted .
At 9:57 , the passenger assault began .
Several passengers had terminated phone calls with loved ones in order to join the revolt .
One of the callers ended her message as follows: '' Everyone 's running up to first class .
I 've got to go .
Bye . ''
The cockpit voice recorder captured the sounds of the passenger assault muffled by the intervening cockpit door .
Some family members who listened to the recording report that they can hear the voice of a loved one among the din .
We can not identify whose voices can be heard .
But the assault was sustained .
In response , Jarrah immediately began to roll the airplane to the left and right , attempting to knock the passengers off balance .
At 9:58:57 , Jarrah told another hijacker in the cockpit to block the door .
Jarrah continued to roll the airplane sharply left and right , but the assault continued .
At 9:59:52 , Jarrah changed tactics and pitched the nose of the airplane up and down to disrupt the assault .
The recorder captured the sounds of loud thumps , crashes , shouts , and breaking glasses and plates .
At 10:00:03 , Jarrah stabilized the airplane .
Five seconds later , Jarrah asked , `` Is that it ?
Shall we finish it off ? '' A hijacker responded , '' No. Not yet .
When they all come , we finish it off . ''
The sounds of fighting continued outside the cockpit .
Again , Jarrah pitched the nose of the aircraft up and down .
At 10:00:26 , a passenger in the background said , '' In the cockpit .
If we do n't we 'll die ! ''
Sixteen seconds later , a passenger yelled , '' Roll it ! ''
Jarrah stopped the violent maneuvers at about 10:01:00 and said , '' Allah is the greatest !
Allah is the greatest ! ''
He then asked another hijacker in the cockpit , '' Is that it ?
I mean , shall we put it down ? '' to which the other replied , '' Yes , put it in it , and pull it down . ''
The passengers continued their assault and at 10:02:23 , a hijacker said , `` Pull it down !
Pull it down ! '' The hijackers remained at the controls but must have judged that the passengers were only seconds from overcoming them .
The airplane headed down ; the control wheel was turned hard to the right .
The airplane rolled onto its back , and one of the hijackers began shouting `` Allah is the greatest .
Allah is the greatest . ''
With the sounds of the passenger counterattack continuing , the aircraft plowed into an empty field in Shanksville , Pennsylvania , at 580 miles per hour , about 20 minutes ' flying time from Washington, D.C.
Jarrah 's objective was to crash his airliner into symbols of the American Republic , the Capitol or the White House .
He was defeated by the alerted , unarmed passengers of United 93 .
IMPROVISING A HOMELAND DEFENSE
The FAA and NORAD
On 9/11 , the defense of U.S. airspace depended on close interaction between two federal agencies : the FAA and the North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) .
The most recent hijacking that involved U.S. air traffic controllers , FAA management , and military coordination had occurred in 1993.90 In order to understand how the two agencies interacted eight years later , we will review their missions , command and control structures , and working relationship on the morning of 9/11 .
FAA Mission and Structure .
As of September 11, 2001 , the FAA was mandated by law to regulate the safety and security of civil aviation .
From an air traffic controller 's perspective , that meant maintaining a safe distance between airborne aircraft .
Many controllers work at the FAA 's 22 Air Route Traffic Control Centers .
They are grouped under regional offices and coordinate closely with the national Air Traffic Control System Command Center , located in Herndon , Virginia , which oversees daily traffic flow within the entire airspace system .
FAA headquarters is ultimately responsible for the management of the National Airspace System .
The Operations Center located at FAA headquarters receives notifications of incidents , including accidents and hijackings .
FAA Control Centers often receive information and make operational decisions independently of one another .
On 9/11 , the four hijacked aircraft were monitored mainly by the centers in Boston , New York , Cleveland , and Indianapolis .
Each center thus had part of the knowledge of what was going on across the system .
What Boston knew was not necessarily known by centers in New York , Cleveland , or Indianapolis , or for that matter by the Command Center in Herndon or by FAA headquarters in Washington .
Controllers track airliners such as the four aircraft hijacked on 9/11 primarily by watching the data from a signal emitted by each aircraft 's transponder equipment .
Those four planes , like all aircraft traveling above 10,000 feet , were required to emit a unique transponder signal while in flight .
On 9/11 , the terrorists turned off the transponders on three of the four hijacked aircraft .
With its transponder off , it is possible , though more difficult , to track an aircraft by its primary radar returns .
But unlike transponder data , primary radar returns do not show the aircraft 's identity and altitude .
Controllers at centers rely so heavily on transponder signals that they usually do not display primary radar returns on their radar scopes .
But they can change the configuration of their scopes so they can see primary radar returns .
They did this on 9/11 when the transponder signals for three of the aircraft disappeared .
Before 9/11 , it was not unheard of for a commercial aircraft to deviate slightly from its course , or for an FAA controller to lose radio contact with a pilot for a short period of time .
A controller could also briefly lose a commercial aircraft 's transponder signal , although this happened much less frequently .
However , the simultaneous loss of radio and transponder signal would be a rare and alarming occurrence , and would normally indicate a catastrophic system failure or an aircraft crash .
In all of these instances , the job of the controller was to reach out to the aircraft , the parent company of the aircraft , and other planes in the vicinity in an attempt to reestablish communications and set the aircraft back on course .
Alarm bells would not start ringing until these efforts-which could take five minutes or more-were tried and had failed .
NORAD Mission and Structure .
NORAD is a binational command established in 1958 between the United States and Canada .
Its mission was , and is , to defend the airspace of North America and protect the continent .
That mission does not distinguish between internal and external threats ; but because NORAD was created to counter the Soviet threat , it came to define its job as defending against external attacks .
The threat of Soviet bombers diminished significantly as the Cold War ended , and the number of NORAD alert sites was reduced from its Cold War high of 26 .
Some within the Pentagon argued in the 1990s that the alert sites should be eliminated entirely .
In an effort to preserve their mission , members of the air defense community advocated the importance of air sovereignty against emerging `` asymmetric threats '' to the United States : drug smuggling , `` non-state and state-sponsored terrorists , '' and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile technology .
NORAD perceived the dominant threat to be from cruise missiles .
Other threats were identified during the late 1990s , including terrorists ' use of aircraft as weapons .
Exercises were conducted to counter this threat , but they were not based on actual intelligence .
In most instances , the main concern was the use of such aircraft to deliver weapons of mass destruction .
Prior to 9/11 , it was understood that an order to shoot down a commercial aircraft would have to be issued by the National Command Authority ( a phrase used to describe the president and secretary of defense ) .
Exercise planners also assumed that the aircraft would originate from outside the United States , allowing time to identify the target and scramble interceptors .
The threat of terrorists hijacking commercial airliners within the United States -and using them as guided missiles-was not recognized by NORAD before 9/11 .
Notwithstanding the identification of these emerging threats , by 9/11 there were only seven alert sites left in the United States , each with two fighter aircraft on alert .
This led some NORAD commanders to worry that NORAD was not postured adequately to protect the United States .
In the United States , NORAD is divided into three sectors .
On 9/11 , all the hijacked aircraft were in NORAD 's Northeast Air Defense Sector ( also known as NEADS ) , which is based in Rome , New York .
That morning NEADS could call on two alert sites , each with one pair of ready fighters : Otis Air National Guard Base in Cape Cod , Massachusetts , and Langley Air Force Base in Hampton , Virginia .
Other facilities , not on `` alert , '' would need time to arm the fighters and organize crews .
NEADS reported to the Continental U.S. NORAD Region ( CONR ) headquarters , in Panama City , Florida , which in turn reported to NORAD headquarters , in Colorado Springs , Colorado .
Interagency Collaboration .
The FAA and NORAD had developed protocols for working together in the event of a hijacking .
As they existed on 9/11 , the protocols for the FAA to obtain military assistance from NORAD required multiple levels of notification and approval at the highest levels of government .
FAA guidance to controllers on hijack procedures assumed that the aircraft pilot would notify the controller via radio or by '' squawking '' a transponder code of `` 7500 '' -the universal code for a hijack in progress .
Controllers would notify their supervisors , who in turn would inform management all the way up to FAA headquarters in Washington .
Headquarters had a hijack coordinator , who was the director of the FAA Office of Civil Aviation Security or his or her designate .
If a hijack was confirmed , procedures called for the hijack coordinator on duty to contact the Pentagon 's National Military Command Center ( NMCC ) and to ask for a military escort aircraft to follow the flight , report anything unusual , and aid search and rescue in the event of an emergency .
The NMCC would then seek approval from the Office of the Secretary of Defense to provide military assistance .
If approval was given , the orders would be transmitted down NORAD 's chain of command .
The NMCC would keep the FAA hijack coordinator up to date and help the FAA centers coordinate directly with the military .
NORAD would receive tracking information for the hijacked aircraft either from joint use radar or from the relevant FAA air traffic control facility .
Every attempt would be made to have the hijacked aircraft squawk 7500 to help NORAD track it .
The protocols did not contemplate an intercept .
They assumed the fighter escort would be discreet , `` vectored to a position five miles directly behind the hijacked aircraft , '' where it could perform its mission to monitor the aircraft 's flight path .
In sum , the protocols in place on 9/11 for the FAA and NORAD to respond to a hijacking presumed that
the hijacked aircraft would be readily identifiable and would not attempt to disappear ;
there would be time to address the problem through the appropriate FAA and NORAD chains of command ; and
the hijacking would take the traditional form : that is , it would not be a suicide hijacking designed to convert the aircraft into a guided missile .
On the morning of 9/11 , the existing protocol was unsuited in every respect for what was about to happen .
American Airlines Flight 11
FAA Awareness .
Although the Boston Center air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was something wrong with American 11 , he did not immediately interpret the plane 's failure to respond as a sign that it had been hijacked .
At 8:14 , when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to 35,000 feet , the controller repeatedly tried to raise the flight .
He reached out to the pilot on the emergency frequency .
Though there was no response , he kept trying to contact the aircraft .
At 8:21 , American 11 turned off its transponder , immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft .
The controller told his supervisor that he thought something was seriously wrong with the plane , although neither suspected a hijacking .
The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a `` no radio '' aircraft .
The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11 .
He became even more concerned as its route changed , moving into another sector 's airspace .
Controllers immediately began to move aircraft out of its path , and asked other aircraft in the vicinity to look for American 11 .
At 8:24:38 , the following transmission came from American 11 : American 11 : We have some planes .
Just stay quiet , and you 'll be okay .
We are returning to the airport .
The controller only heard something unintelligible ; he did not hear the specific words `` we have some planes . ''
The next transmission came seconds later : American 11 : Nobody move .
Everything will be okay .
If you try to make any moves , you 'll endanger yourself and the airplane .
Just stay quiet .
The controller told us that he then knew it was a hijacking .
He alerted his supervisor , who assigned another controller to assist him .
He redoubled his efforts to ascertain the flight 's altitude .
Because the controller did n't understand the initial transmission , the manager of Boston Center instructed his quality assurance specialist to `` pull the tape '' of the radio transmission , listen to it closely , and report back .
Between 8:25 and 8:32 , in accordance with the FAA protocol , Boston Center managers started notifying their chain of command that American 11 had been hijacked .
At 8:28 , Boston Center called the Command Center in Herndon to advise that it believed American 11 had been hijacked and was heading toward New York Center 's airspace .
By this time , American 11 had taken a dramatic turn to the south .
At 8:32 , the Command Center passed word of a possible hijacking to the Operations Center at FAA headquarters .
The duty officer replied that security personnel at headquarters had just begun discussing the apparent hijack on a conference call with the New England regional office .
FAA headquarters began to follow the hijack protocol but did not contact the NMCC to request a fighter escort .
The Herndon Command Center immediately established a teleconference between Boston , New York , and Cleveland Centers so that Boston Center could help the others understand what was happening .
At 8:34 , the Boston Center controller received a third transmission from American 11:
American 11 : Nobody move please .
We are going back to the airport .
Do n't try to make any stupid moves .
In the succeeding minutes , controllers were attempting to ascertain the altitude of the southbound flight .
Military Notification and Response .
Boston Center did not follow the protocol in seeking military assistance through the prescribed chain of command .
In addition to notifications within the FAA , Boston Center took the initiative , at 8:34 , to contact the military through the FAA 's Cape Cod facility .
The center also tried to contact a former alert site in Atlantic City , unaware it had been phased out .
At 8:37:52 , Boston Center reached NEADS .
This was the first notification received by the military-at any level-that American 11 had been hijacked:
FAA : Hi . Boston Center TMU [ Traffic Management Unit ] , we have a problem here .
We have a hijacked aircraft headed towards New York , and we need you guys to , we need someone to scramble some F-16s or something up there , help us out .
NEADS : Is this real-world or exercise ?
FAA : No , this is not an exercise , not a test .
NEADS ordered to battle stations the two F-15 alert aircraft at Otis Air Force Base in Falmouth , Massachusetts , 153 miles away from New York City .
The air defense of America began with this call .
At NEADS , the report of the hijacking was relayed immediately to Battle Commander Colonel Robert Marr .
After ordering the Otis fighters to battle stations , Colonel Marr phoned Major General Larry Arnold , commanding general of the First Air Force and NORAD 's Continental Region .
Marr sought authorization to scramble the Otis fighters .
General Arnold later recalled instructing Marr to `` go ahead and scramble them , and we 'll get authorities later . ''
General Arnold then called NORAD headquarters to report .
F-15 fighters were scrambled at 8:46 from Otis Air Force Base .
But NEADS did not know where to send the alert fighter aircraft , and the officer directing the fighters pressed for more information: '' I do n't know where I 'm scrambling these guys to .
I need a direction , a destination . ''
Because the hijackers had turned off the plane 's transponder , NEADS personnel spent the next minutes searching their radar scopes for the primary radar return .
American 11 struck the NorthTower at 8:46 .
Shortly after 8:50 , while NEADS personnel were still trying to locate the flight , word reached them that a plane had hit the World Trade Center .
Radar data show the Otis fighters were airborne at 8:53 .
Lacking a target , they were vectored toward military-controlled airspace off the Long Island coast .
To avoid New York area air traffic and uncertain about what to do , the fighters were brought down to military airspace to `` hold as needed . ''
From 9:09 to 9:13 , the Otis fighters stayed in this holding pattern .
In summary , NEADS received notice of the hijacking nine minutes before it struck the North Tower .
That nine minutes ' notice before impact was the most the military would receive of any of the four hijackings .
United Airlines Flight 175
FAA Awareness .
One of the last transmissions from United Airlines Flight 175 is , in retrospect , chilling .
By 8:40 , controllers at the FAA 's New York Center were seeking information on American 11 .
At approximately 8:42 , shortly after entering New York Center 's airspace , the pilot of United 175 broke in with the following transmission:
UAL 175 : New York UAL 175 heavy .
FAA : UAL 175 go ahead .
UAL 175 : Yeah .
We figured we 'd wait to go to your center .
Ah , we heard a suspicious transmission on our departure out of Boston , ah , with someone , ah , it sounded like someone keyed the mikes and said ah everyone ah stay in your seats .
FAA : Oh , okay .
I 'll pass that along over here .
Minutes later , United 175 turned southwest without clearance from air traffic control .
At 8:47 , seconds after the impact of American 11 , United 175 's transponder code changed , and then changed again .
These changes were not noticed for several minutes , however , because the same New York Center controller was assigned to both American 11 and United 175 .
The controller knew American 11 was hijacked ; he was focused on searching for it after the aircraft disappeared at 8:46 .
At 8:48 , while the controller was still trying to locate American 11 , a New York Center manager provided the following report on a Command Center teleconference about American 11:
Manager , New York Center : Okay .
This is New York Center .
We 're watching the airplane .
I also had conversation with American Airlines , and they 've told us that they believe that one of their stewardesses was stabbed and that there are people in the cockpit that have control of the aircraft , and that 's all the information they have right now .
The New York Center controller and manager were unaware that American 11 had already crashed .
At 8:51 , the controller noticed the transponder change from United 175 and tried to contact the aircraft .
There was no response .
Beginning at 8:52 , the controller made repeated attempts to reach the crew of United 175 .
Still no response .
The controller checked his radio equipment and contacted another controller at 8:53 , saying that `` we may have a hijack '' and that he could not find the aircraft .
Another commercial aircraft in the vicinity then radioed in with `` reports over the radio of a commuter plane hitting the World Trade Center . ''
The controller spent the next several minutes handing off the other flights on his scope to other controllers and moving aircraft out of the way of the unidentified aircraft ( believed to be United 175 ) as it moved southwest and then turned northeast toward New York City .
At about 8:55 , the controller in charge notified a New York Center manager that she believed United 175 had also been hijacked .
The manager tried to notify the regional managers and was told that they were discussing a hijacked aircraft ( presumably American 11 ) and refused to be disturbed .
At 8:58 , the New York Center controller searching for United 175 told another New York controller `` we might have a hijack over here , two of them . ''
Between 9:01 and 9:02 , a manager from New York Center told the Command Center in Herndon :
Manager , New York Center : We have several situations going on here .
It 's escalating big , big time .
We need to get the military involved with us. . . .
We 're , we 're involved with something else , we have other aircraft that may have a similar situation going on here .
The `` other aircraft '' referred to by New York Center was United 175 .
Evidence indicates that this conversation was the only notice received by either FAA headquarters or the Herndon Command Center prior to the second crash that there had been a second hijacking .
While the Command Center was told about this `` other aircraft '' at 9:01 , New York Center contacted New York terminal approach control and asked for help in locating United 175 .
Terminal : I got somebody who keeps coasting but it looks like he 's going into one of the small airports down there .
Center : Hold on a second .
I 'm trying to bring him up here and get you-There he is right there .
Hold on .
Terminal : Got him just out of 9,500-9,000 now .
Center : Do you know who he is ?
Terminal : We 're just , we just we do n't know who he is .
We 're just picking him up now .
Center ( at 9:02 ) : Alright .
Heads up man , it looks like another one coming in .
The controllers observed the plane in a rapid descent ; the radar data terminated over Lower Manhattan .
At 9:03 , United 175 crashed into the South Tower .
Meanwhile , a manager from Boston Center reported that they had deciphered what they had heard in one of the first hijacker transmissions from American 11 : Boston Center : Hey . . . you still there ?
New England Region : Yes , I am .
Boston Center : . . . as far as the tape , Bobby seemed to think the guy said that `` we have planes . ''
Now , I do n't know if it was because it was the accent , or if there 's more than one , but I 'm gon na , I 'm gon na reconfirm that for you , and I 'll get back to you real quick .
Okay ?
New England Region : Appreciate it .
Unidentified Female Voice : They have what ?
Boston Center : Planes , as in plural .
Boston Center : It sounds like , we 're talking to New York , that there 's another one aimed at the World Trade Center .
New England Region : There 's another aircraft ?
Boston Center : A second one just hit the Trade Center .
New England Region : Okay .
Yeah , we got ta get-we got ta alert the military real quick on this .
Boston Center immediately advised the New England Region that it was going to stop all departures at airports under its control .
At 9:05 , Boston Center confirmed for both the FAA Command Center and the New England Region that the hijackers aboard American 11 said `` we have planes . ''
At the same time , New York Center declared `` ATC zero '' -meaning that aircraft were not permitted to depart from , arrive at , or travel through New York Center 's airspace until further notice .
Within minutes of the second impact , Boston Center instructed its controllers to inform all aircraft in its airspace of the events in New York and to advise aircraft to heighten cockpit security .
Boston Center asked the Herndon Command Center to issue a similar cockpit security alert nationwide .
We have found no evidence to suggest that the Command Center acted on this request or issued any type of cockpit security alert .
Military Notification and Response .
The first indication that the NORAD air defenders had of the second hijacked aircraft , United 175 , came in a phone call from New York Center to NEADS at 9:03 .
The notice came at about the time the plane was hitting the South Tower .
By 9:08 , the mission crew commander at NEADS learned of the second explosion at the World Trade Center and decided against holding the fighters in military airspace away from Manhattan :
Mission Crew Commander , NEADS : This is what I foresee that we probably need to do .
We need to talk to FAA .
We need to tell 'em if this stuff is gon na keep on going , we need to take those fighters , put 'em over Manhattan .
That 's best thing , that 's the best play right now .
So coordinate with the FAA .
Tell 'em if there 's more out there , which we do n't know , let 's get 'em over Manhattan .
At least we got some kind of play .
The FAA cleared the airspace .
Radar data show that at 9:13 , when the Otis fighters were about 115 miles away from the city , the fighters exited their holding pattern and set a course direct for Manhattan .
They arrived at 9:25 and established a combat air patrol ( CAP ) over the city .
Because the Otis fighters had expended a great deal of fuel in flying first to military airspace and then to New York , the battle commanders were concerned about refueling .
NEADS considered scrambling alert fighters from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia to New York , to provide backup .
The Langley fighters were placed on battle stations at 9:09.137 NORAD had no indication that any other plane had been hijacked .
American Airlines Flight 77 FAA Awareness .
American 77 began deviating from its flight plan at 8:54 , with a slight turn toward the south .
Two minutes later , it disappeared completely from radar at Indianapolis Center , which was controlling the flight .
The controller tracking American 77 told us he noticed the aircraft turning to the southwest , and then saw the data disappear .
The controller looked for primary radar returns .
He searched along the plane 's projected flight path and the airspace to the southwest where it had started to turn .
No primary targets appeared .
He tried the radios , first calling the aircraft directly , then the airline .
Again there was nothing .
At this point , the Indianapolis controller had no knowledge of the situation in New York .
He did not know that other aircraft had been hijacked .
He believed American 77 had experienced serious electrical or mechanical failure , or both , and was gone .
Shortly after 9:00 , Indianapolis Center started notifying other agencies that American 77 was missing and had possibly crashed .
At 9:08 , Indianapolis Center asked Air Force Search and Rescue at Langley Air Force Base to look for a downed aircraft .
The center also contacted the West Virginia State Police and asked whether any reports of a downed aircraft had been received .
At 9:09 , it reported the loss of contact to the FAA regional center , which passed this information to FAA headquarters at 9:24 .
By 9:20 , Indianapolis Center learned that there were other hijacked aircraft , and began to doubt its initial assumption that American 77 had crashed .
A discussion of this concern between the manager at Indianapolis and the Command Center in Herndon prompted it to notify some FAA field facilities that American 77 was lost .
By 9:21 , the Command Center , some FAA field facilities , and American Airlines had started to search for American 77 .
They feared it had been hijacked .
At 9:25 , the Command Center advised FAA headquarters of the situation .
The failure to find a primary radar return for American 77 led us to investigate this issue further .
Radar reconstructions performed after 9/11 reveal that FAA radar equipment tracked the flight from the moment its transponder was turned off at 8:56 .
But for 8 minutes and 13 seconds , between 8:56 and 9:05 , this primary radar information on American 77 was not displayed to controllers at Indianapolis Center .
The reasons are technical , arising from the way the software processed radar information , as well as from poor primary radar coverage where American 77 was flying .
According to the radar reconstruction , American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05 , east of its last known position .
The target remained in Indianapolis Center 's airspace for another six minutes , then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center 's airspace at 9:10 .
As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft , two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight 's projected path , not east-where the aircraft was now heading .
Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77 .
In sum , Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around .
By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage , controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west .
Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing , neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets .
American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C.
By 9:25 , FAA 's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center .
They knew American 77 was lost .
At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said `` we have some planes . ''
Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount .
A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a `` nationwide ground stop . ''
While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters , the Command Center ordered one at 9:25 .
The Command Center kept looking for American 77 .
At 9:21 , it advised the Dulles terminal control facility , and Dulles urged its controllers to look for primary targets .
At 9:32 , they found one .
Several of the Dulles controllers `` observed a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed '' and notified Reagan National Airport .
FAA personnel at both Reagan National and Dulles airports notified the Secret Service .
The aircraft 's identity or type was unknown .
Reagan National controllers then vectored an unarmed National Guard C- 130H cargo aircraft , which had just taken off en route to Minnesota , to identify and follow the suspicious aircraft .
The C-130H pilot spotted it , identified it as a Boeing 757 , attempted to follow its path , and at 9:38 , seconds after impact , reported to the control tower: '' looks like that aircraft crashed into the Pentagon sir . ''
Military Notification and Response .
NORAD heard nothing about the search for American 77 .
Instead , the NEADS air defenders heard renewed reports about a plane that no longer existed : American 11 .
At 9:21 , NEADS received a report from the FAA : FAA : Military , Boston Center .
I just had a report that American 11 is still in the air , and it 's on its way towards-heading towards Washington .
NEADS : Okay .
American 11 is still in the air ?
FAA : Yes .
NEADS : On its way towards Washington ?
FAA : That was another-it was evidently another aircraft that hit the tower .
That 's the latest report we have .
NEADS : Okay .
FAA : I 'm going to try to confirm an ID for you , but I would assume he 's somewhere over , uh , either New Jersey or somewhere further south .
NEADS : Okay .
So American 11 is n't the hijack at all then , right ?
FAA : No , he is a hijack .
NEADS : He-American 11 is a hijack ?
FAA : Yes .
NEADS : And he 's heading into Washington ?
FAA : Yes .
This could be a third aircraft .
The mention of a `` third aircraft '' was not a reference to American 77 .
There was confusion at that moment in the FAA .
Two planes had struck the World Trade Center , and Boston Center had heard from FAA headquarters in Washington that American 11 was still airborne .
We have been unable to identify the source of this mistaken FAA information .
The NEADS technician who took this call from the FAA immediately passed the word to the mission crew commander , who reported to the NEADS battle commander : Mission Crew Commander , NEADS : Okay , uh , American Airlines is still airborne .
Eleven , the first guy , he 's heading towards Washington .
Okay ?
I think we need to scramble Langley right now .
And I 'm gon na take the fighters from Otis , try to chase this guy down if I can find him .
After consulting with NEADS command , the crew commander issued the order at 9:23 : '' Okay . . . scramble Langley .
Head them towards the Washington area. . . .
[ I ] f they 're there then we 'll run on them. . . .
These guys are smart . ''
That order was processed and transmitted to Langley Air Force Base at 9:24 .
Radar data show the Langley fighters airborne at 9:30 .
NEADS decided to keep the Otis fighters over New York .
The heading of the Langley fighters was adjusted to send them to the Baltimore area .
The mission crew commander explained to us that the purpose was to position the Langley fighters between the reported southbound American 11 and the nation 's capital .
At the suggestion of the Boston Center 's military liaison , NEADS contacted the FAA 's Washington Center to ask about American 11 .
In the course of the conversation , a Washington Center manager informed NEADS : '' We 're looking- we also lost American 77 . ''
The time was 9:34 .
This was the first notice to the military that American 77 was missing , and it had come by chance .
If NEADS had not placed that call , the NEADS air defenders would have received no information whatsoever that the flight was even missing , although the FAA had been searching for it .
No one at FAA headquarters ever asked for military assistance with American 77 .
At 9:36 , the FAA 's Boston Center called NEADS and relayed the discovery about an unidentified aircraft closing in on Washington : '' Latest report .
Aircraft VFR [ visual flight rules ] six miles southeast of the White House . . . .
Six , southwest .
Six , southwest of the White House , deviating away . ''
This startling news prompted the mission crew commander at NEADS to take immediate control of the airspace to clear a flight path for the Langley fighters: '' Okay , we 're going to turn it . . . crank it up. . . .
Run them to the White House . ''
He then discovered , to his surprise , that the Langley fighters were not headed north toward the Baltimore area as instructed , but east over the ocean . ''
I do n't care how many windows you break , '' he said . ''
Damn it. . . .
Okay .
Push them back . ''
The Langley fighters were heading east , not north , for three reasons .
First , unlike a normal scramble order , this order did not include a distance to the target or the target 's location .
Second , a `` generic '' flight plan-prepared to get the aircraft airborne and out of local airspace quickly-incorrectly led the Langley fighters to believe they were ordered to fly due east ( 090 ) for 60 miles .
Third , the lead pilot and local FAA controller incorrectly assumed the flight plan instruction to go `` 090 for 60 '' superseded the original scramble order .
After the 9:36 call to NEADS about the unidentified aircraft a few miles from the White House , the Langley fighters were ordered to Washington, D.C. Controllers at NEADS located an unknown primary radar track , but `` it kind of faded '' over Washington .
The time was 9:38 .
The Pentagon had been struck by American 77 at 9:37:46 .
The Langley fighters were about 150 miles away .
Right after the Pentagon was hit , NEADS learned of another possible hijacked aircraft .
It was an aircraft that in fact had not been hijacked at all .
After the second World Trade Center crash , Boston Center managers recognized that both aircraft were transcontinental 767 jetliners that had departed Logan Airport .
Remembering the `` we have some planes '' remark , Boston Center guessed that Delta 1989 might also be hijacked .
Boston Center called NEADS at 9:41 and identified Delta 1989 , a 767 jet that had left Logan Airport for Las Vegas , as a possible hijack .
NEADS warned the FAA 's Cleveland Center to watch Delta 1989 .
The Command Center and FAA headquarters watched it too .
During the course of the morning , there were multiple erroneous reports of hijacked aircraft .
The report of American 11 heading south was the first ; Delta 1989 was the second .
NEADS never lost track of Delta 1989 , and even ordered fighter aircraft from Ohio and Michigan to intercept it .
The flight never turned off its transponder .
NEADS soon learned that the aircraft was not hijacked , and tracked Delta 1989 as it reversed course over Toledo , headed east , and landed in Cleveland .
But another aircraft was heading toward Washington , an aircraft about which NORAD had heard nothing : United 93 .
United Airlines Flight 93 FAA Awareness .
At 9:27 , after having been in the air for 45 minutes , United 93 acknowledged a transmission from the Cleveland Center controller .
This was the last normal contact the FAA had with the flight .
Less than a minute later , the Cleveland controller and the pilots of aircraft in the vicinity heard `` a radio transmission of unintelligible sounds of possible screaming or a struggle from an unknown origin . ''
The controller responded , seconds later : `` Somebody call Cleveland ? '' This was followed by a second radio transmission , with sounds of screaming .
The Cleveland Center controllers began to try to identify the possible source of the transmissions , and noticed that United 93 had descended some 700 feet .
The controller attempted again to raise United 93 several times , with no response .
At 9:30 , the controller began to poll the other flights on his frequency to determine if they had heard the screaming ; several said they had .
At 9:32 , a third radio transmission came over the frequency: '' Keep remaining sitting .
We have a bomb on board . ''
The controller understood , but chose to respond : `` Calling Cleveland Center , you 're unreadable .
Say again , slowly . ''
He notified his supervisor , who passed the notice up the chain of command .
By 9:34 , word of the hijacking had reached FAA headquarters .
FAA headquarters had by this time established an open line of communication with the Command Center at Herndon and instructed it to poll all its centers about suspect aircraft .
The Command Center executed the request and , a minute later , Cleveland Center reported that `` United 93 may have a bomb on board . ''
At 9:34 , the Command Center relayed the information concerning United 93 to FAA headquarters .
At approximately 9:36 , Cleveland advised the Command Center that it was still tracking United 93 and specifically inquired whether someone had requested the military to launch fighter aircraft to intercept the aircraft .
Cleveland even told the Command Center it was prepared to contact a nearby military base to make the request .
The Command Center told Cleveland that FAA personnel well above them in the chain of command had to make the decision to seek military assistance and were working on the issue .
Between 9:34 and 9:38 , the Cleveland controller observed United 93 climbing to 40,700 feet and immediately moved several aircraft out its way .
The controller continued to try to contact United 93 , and asked whether the pilot could confirm that he had been hijacked .
There was no response .
Then , at 9:39 , a fourth radio transmission was heard from United 93 : Ziad Jarrah : Uh , this is the captain .
Would like you all to remain seated .
There is a bomb on board and are going back to the airport , and to have our demands [ unintelligible ] .
Please remain quiet .
The controller responded : `` United 93 , understand you have a bomb on board .
Go ahead . ''
The flight did not respond .
From 9:34 to 10:08 , a Command Center facility manager provided frequent updates to Acting Deputy Administrator Monte Belger and other executives at FAA headquarters as United 93 headed toward Washington, D.C. At 9:41 , Cleveland Center lost United 93 's transponder signal .
The controller located it on primary radar , matched its position with visual sightings from other aircraft , and tracked the flight as it turned east , then south .
At 9:42 , the Command Center learned from news reports that a plane had struck the Pentagon .
The Command Center 's national operations manager , Ben Sliney , ordered all FAA facilities to instruct all aircraft to land at the nearest airport .
This was an unprecedented order .
The air traffic control system handled it with great skill , as about 4,500 commercial and general aviation aircraft soon landed without incident .
At 9:46 the Command Center updated FAA headquarters that United 93 was now `` twenty-nine minutes out of Washington, D.C. ''
At 9:49 , 13 minutes after Cleveland Center had asked about getting military help , the Command Center suggested that someone at headquarters should decide whether to request military assistance : FAA Headquarters : They 're pulling Jeff away to go talk about United 93 .
Command Center : Uh , do we want to think , uh , about scrambling aircraft ?
FAA Headquarters : Oh , God , I do n't know .
Command Center : Uh , that 's a decision somebody 's gon na have to make probably in the next ten minutes .
FAA Headquarters : Uh , ya know everybody just left the room .
At 9:53 , FAA headquarters informed the Command Center that the deputy director for air traffic services was talking to Monte Belger about scrambling aircraft .
Then the Command Center informed headquarters that controllers had lost track of United 93 over the Pittsburgh area .
Within seconds , the Command Center received a visual report from another aircraft , and informed headquarters that the aircraft was 20 miles northwest of Johnstown .
United 93 was spotted by another aircraft , and , at 10:01 , the Command Center advised FAA headquarters that one of the aircraft had seen United 93 `` waving his wings . ''
The aircraft had witnessed the hijackers ' efforts to defeat the passengers ' counterattack .
United 93 crashed in Pennsylvania at 10:03:11 , 125 miles from Washington, D.C. The precise crash time has been the subject of some dispute .
The 10:03:11 impact time is supported by previous National Transportation Safety Board analysis and by evidence from the Commission staff 's analysis of radar , the flight data recorder , the cockpit voice recorder , infrared satellite data , and air traffic control transmissions .
Five minutes later , the Command Center forwarded this update to headquarters : Command Center : O.K. Uh , there is now on that United 93 .
FAA Headquarters : Yes .
Command Center : There is a report of black smoke in the last position I gave you , fifteen miles south of Johnstown .
FAA Headquarters : From the airplane or from the ground ?
Command Center : Uh , they 're speculating it 's from the aircraft .
FAA Headquarters : Okay .
Command Center : Uh , who , it hit the ground .
That 's what they 're speculating , that 's speculation only .
The aircraft that spotted the `` black smoke '' was the same unarmed Air National Guard cargo plane that had seen American 77 crash into the Pentagon 27 minutes earlier .
It had resumed its flight to Minnesota and saw the smoke from the crash of United 93 , less than two minutes after the plane went down .
At 10:17 , the Command Center advised headquarters of its conclusion that United 93 had indeed crashed .
Despite the discussions about military assistance , no one from FAA headquarters requested military assistance regarding United 93 .
Nor did any manager at FAA headquarters pass any of the information it had about United 93 to the military .
Military Notification and Response .
NEADS first received a call about United 93 from the military liaison at Cleveland Center at 10:07 .
Unaware that the aircraft had already crashed , Cleveland passed to NEADS the aircraft 's last known latitude and longitude .
NEADS was never able to locate United 93 on radar because it was already in the ground .
At the same time , the NEADS mission crew commander was dealing with the arrival of the Langley fighters over Washington, D.C. , sorting out what their orders were with respect to potential targets .
Shortly after 10:10 , and having no knowledge either that United 93 had been heading toward Washington or that it had crashed , he explicitly instructed the Langley fighters : `` negative- negative clearance to shoot '' aircraft over the nation 's capital .
The news of a reported bomb on board United 93 spread quickly at NEADS .
The air defenders searched for United 93 's primary radar return and tried to locate other fighters to scramble .
NEADS called Washington Center to report : NEADS : I also want to give you a heads-up , Washington .
FAA ( DC ) : Go ahead .
NEADS : United nine three , have you got information on that yet ?
FAA : Yeah , he 's down .
NEADS : He 's down ?
FAA : Yes .
NEADS : When did he land ?
'Cause we have got confirmation- FAA : He did not land .
NEADS : Oh , he 's down ?
Down ?
FAA : Yes .
Somewhere up northeast of Camp David .
NEADS: Northeast of Camp David .
FAA : That 's the last report .
They do n't know exactly where .
The time of notification of the crash of United 93 was 10:15 .
The NEADS air defenders never located the flight or followed it on their radar scopes .
The flight had already crashed by the time they learned it was hijacked .
Clarifying the Record
The defense of U.S. airspace on 9/11 was not conducted in accord with preexisting training and protocols .
It was improvised by civilians who had never handled a hijacked aircraft that attempted to disappear , and by a military unprepared for the transformation of commercial aircraft into weapons of mass destruction .
As it turned out , the NEADS air defenders had nine minutes ' notice on the first hijacked plane , no advance notice on the second , no advance notice on the third , and no advance notice on the fourth .
We do not believe that the true picture of that morning reflects discredit on the operational personnel at NEADS or FAA facilities .
NEADS commanders and officers actively sought out information , and made the best judgments they could on the basis of what they knew .
Individual FAA controllers , facility managers , and Command Center managers thought outside the box in recommending a nationwide alert , in ground-stopping local traffic , and , ultimately , in deciding to land all aircraft and executing that unprecedented order flawlessly .
More than the actual events , inaccurate government accounts of those events made it appear that the military was notified in time to respond to two of the hijackings , raising questions about the adequacy of the response .
Those accounts had the effect of deflecting questions about the military 's capacity to obtain timely and accurate information from its own sources .
In addition , they overstated the FAA 's ability to provide the military with timely and useful information that morning .
In public testimony before this Commission in May 2003 , NORAD officials stated that at 9:16 , NEADS received hijack notification of United 93 from the FAA .
This statement was incorrect .
There was no hijack to report at 9:16 .
United 93 was proceeding normally at that time .
In this same public testimony , NORAD officials stated that at 9:24 , NEADS received notification of the hijacking of American 77 .
This statement was also incorrect .
The notice NEADS received at 9:24 was that American 11 had not hit the World Trade Center and was heading for Washington, D.C.
In their testimony and in other public accounts , NORAD officials also stated that the Langley fighters were scrambled to respond to the notifications about American 77,178 United 93 , or both .
These statements were incorrect as well .
The fighters were scrambled because of the report that American 11 was heading south , as is clear not just from taped conversations at NEADS but also from taped conversations at FAA centers ; contemporaneous logs compiled at NEADS , Continental Region headquarters , and NORAD ; and other records .
Yet this response to a phantom aircraft was not recounted in a single public timeline or statement issued by the FAA or Department of Defense .
The inaccurate accounts created the impression that the Langley scramble was a logical response to an actual hijacked aircraft .
In fact , not only was the scramble prompted by the mistaken information about American 11 , but NEADS never received notice that American 77 was hijacked .
It was notified at 9:34 that American 77 was lost .
Then , minutes later , NEADS was told that an unknown plane was 6 miles southwest of the White House .
Only then did the already scrambled airplanes start moving directly toward Washington, D.C.
Thus the military did not have 14 minutes to respond to American 77 , as testimony to the Commission in May 2003 suggested .
It had at most one or two minutes to react to the unidentified plane approaching Washington , and the fighters were in the wrong place to be able to help .
They had been responding to a report about an aircraft that did not exist .
Nor did the military have 47 minutes to respond to United 93 , as would be implied by the account that it received notice of the flight 's hijacking at 9:16 .
By the time the military learned about the flight , it had crashed .
We now turn to the role of national leadership in the events that morning .
NATIONAL CRISIS MANAGEMENT
When American 11 struck the World Trade Center at 8:46 , no one in the White House or traveling with the President knew that it had been hijacked .
While that information circulated within the FAA , we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46 .
Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN .
Within the FAA , the administrator , Jane Garvey , and her acting deputy , Monte Belger , had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed .
Others in the agency were aware of it , as we explained earlier in this chapter .
Inside the National Military Command Center , the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident .
At about 9:00 , the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information .
Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11 , the scrambling of jets was not discussed .
In Sarasota , Florida , the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School , where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education .
White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small , twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center .
The President 's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error .
At 8:55 , before entering the classroom , the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice , who was at the White House .
She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center , adding `` that 's all we know right now , Mr. President . ''
At the White House , Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center .
The Vice President was wondering `` how the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center '' when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower .
Elsewhere in the White House , a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin .
In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident , the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules .
The Agencies Confer
When they learned a second plane had struck the World Trade Center , nearly everyone in the White House told us , they immediately knew it was not an accident .
The Secret Service initiated a number of security enhancements around the White House complex .
The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked aircraft , or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington .
These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York .
The FAA and White House Teleconferences .
The FAA , the White House , and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30 .
Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00 - included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department , none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings .
At about 9:20 , security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies , including the Defense Department .
The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic , it was of little value , and there were other important tasks .
The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit .
Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11 .
Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call .
At the White House , the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke , a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism .
Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA ; the FBI ; the departments of State, Justice , and Defense ; the FAA ; and the White House shelter .
The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40 .
The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference-at about 9:40 -was the physical security of the President , the White House , and federal agencies .
Immediately thereafter it was reported that a plane had hit the Pentagon .
We found no evidence that video teleconference participants had any prior information that American 77 had been hijacked and was heading directly toward Washington .
Indeed , it is not clear to us that the video teleconference was fully under way before 9:37 , when the Pentagon was struck .
Garvey , Belger , and other senior officials from FAA headquarters participated in this video teleconference at various times .
We do not know who from Defense participated , but we know that in the first hour none of the personnel involved in managing the crisis did .
And none of the information conveyed in the White House video teleconference , at least in the first hour , was being passed to the NMCC .
As one witness recalled , `` [ It ] was almost like there were parallel decisionmaking processes going on ; one was a voice conference orchestrated by the NMCC . . . and then there was the [ White House video teleconference ] . . . .
[ I ] n my mind they were competing venues for command and control and decisionmaking . ''
At 10:03 , the conference received reports of more missing aircraft , `` 2 possibly 3 aloft , '' and learned of a combat air patrol over Washington .
There was discussion of the need for rules of engagement .
Clarke reported that they were asking the President for authority to shoot down aircraft .
Confirmation of that authority came at 10:25 , but the commands were already being conveyed in more direct contacts with the Pentagon .
The Pentagon Teleconferences .
Inside the National Military Command Center , the deputy director for operations immediately thought the second strike was a terrorist attack .
The job of the NMCC in such an emergency is to gather the relevant parties and establish the chain of command between the National Command Authority -the president and the secretary of defense- and those who need to carry out their orders .
On the morning of September 11 , Secretary Rumsfeld was having breakfast at the Pentagon with a group of members of Congress .
He then returned to his office for his daily intelligence briefing .
The Secretary was informed of the second strike in New York during the briefing ; he resumed the briefing while awaiting more information .
After the Pentagon was struck , Secretary Rumsfeld went to the parking lot to assist with rescue efforts .
Inside the NMCC , the deputy director for operations called for an allpurpose `` significant event '' conference .
It began at 9:29 , with a brief recap : two aircraft had struck the World Trade Center , there was a confirmed hijacking of American 11 , and Otis fighters had been scrambled .
The FAA was asked to provide an update , but the line was silent because the FAA had not been added to the call .
A minute later , the deputy director stated that it had just been confirmed that American 11 was still airborne and heading toward D.C. He directed the transition to an air threat conference call .
NORAD confirmed that American 11 was airborne and heading toward Washington , relaying the erroneous FAA information already mentioned .
The call then ended , at about 9:34 .
It resumed at 9:37 as an air threat conference call , * which lasted more than eight hours .
The President , Vice President , Secretary of Defense , Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley all participated in this teleconference at various times , as did military personnel from the White House underground shelter and the President 's military aide on Air Force One .
Operators worked feverishly to include the FAA , but they had equipment problems and difficulty finding secure phone numbers .
NORAD asked three times before 10:03 to confirm the presence of the FAA in the teleconference .
The FAA representative who finally joined the call at 10:17 had no familiarity with or responsibility for hijackings , no access to decisionmakers , and none of the information available to senior FAA officials .
* All times given for this conference call are estimates , which we and the Department of Defense believe to be accurate within a � 3 minute margin of error .
We found no evidence that , at this critical time , NORAD 's top commanders , in Florida or Cheyenne Mountain , coordinated with their counterparts at FAA headquarters to improve awareness and organize a common response .
Lower-level officials improvised-for example , the FAA 's Boston Center bypassed the chain of command and directly contacted NEADS after the first hijacking .
But the highest-level Defense Department officials relied on the NMCC 's air threat conference , in which the FAA did not participate for the first 48 minutes .
At 9:39 , the NMCC 's deputy director for operations , a military officer , opened the call from the Pentagon , which had just been hit .
He began: '' An air attack against North America may be in progress .
NORAD , what 's the situation ? ''
NORAD said it had conflicting reports .
Its latest information was `` of a possible hijacked aircraft taking off out of JFK en route to Washington D.C. ''
The NMCC reported a crash into the mall side of the Pentagon and requested that the Secretary of Defense be added to the conference .
At 9:44 , NORAD briefed the conference on the possible hijacking of Delta 1989 .
Two minutes later , staff reported that they were still trying to locate Secretary Rumsfeld and Vice Chairman Myers .
The Vice Chairman joined the conference shortly before 10:00 ; the Secretary , shortly before 10:30 .
The Chairman was out of the country .
At 9:48 , a representative from the White House shelter asked if there were any indications of another hijacked aircraft .
The deputy director for operations mentioned the Delta flight and concluded that `` that would be the fourth possible hijack . ''
At 9:49 , the commander of NORAD directed all air sovereignty aircraft to battle stations , fully armed .
At 9:59 , an Air Force lieutenant colonel working in the White House Military Office joined the conference and stated he had just talked to Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley .
The White House requested ( 1 ) the implementation of continuity of government measures , ( 2 ) fighter escorts for Air Force One , and ( 3 ) a fighter combat air patrol over Washington, D.C.
By 10:03 , when United 93 crashed in Pennsylvania , there had been no mention of its hijacking and the FAA had not yet been added to the teleconference .
The President and the Vice President The President was seated in a classroom when , at 9:05 , Andrew Card whispered to him : `` A second plane hit the second tower .
America is under attack . ''
The President told us his instinct was to project calm , not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis .
The press was standing behind the children ; he saw their phones and pagers start to ring .
The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening .
The President remained in the classroom for another five to seven minutes,
while the children continued reading .
He then returned to a holding room shortly before 9:15 , where he was briefed by staff and saw television coverage .
He next spoke to Vice President Cheney , Dr . Rice , New York Governor George Pataki , and FBI Director Robert Mueller .
He decided to make a brief statement from the school before leaving for the airport .
The Secret Service told us they were anxious to move the President to a safer location , but did not think it imperative for him to run out the door .
Between 9:15 and 9:30 , the staff was busy arranging a return to Washington , while the President consulted his senior advisers about his remarks .
No one in the traveling party had any information during this time that other aircraft were hijacked or missing .
Staff was in contact with the White House Situation Room , but as far as we could determine , no one with the President was in contact with the Pentagon .
The focus was on the President 's statement to the nation .
The only decision made during this time was to return to Washington .
The President 's motorcade departed at 9:35 , and arrived at the airport between 9:42 and 9:45 .
During the ride the President learned about the attack on the Pentagon .
He boarded the aircraft , asked the Secret Service about the safety of his family , and called the Vice President .
According to notes of the call , at about 9:45 the President told the Vice President: '' Sounds like we have a minor war going on here , I heard about the Pentagon .
We 're at war . . . somebody 's going to pay . ''
About this time , Card , the lead Secret Service agent , the President 's military aide , and the pilot were conferring on a possible destination for Air Force One .
The Secret Service agent felt strongly that the situation in Washington was too unstable for the President to return there , and Card agreed .
The President strongly wanted to return to Washington and only grudgingly agreed to go elsewhere .
The issue was still undecided when the President conferred with the Vice President at about the time Air Force One was taking off .
The Vice President recalled urging the President not to return to Washington .
Air Force One departed at about 9:54 without any fixed destination .
The objective was to get up in the air-as fast and as high as possible-and then decide where to go .
At 9:33 , the tower supervisor at Reagan National Airport picked up a hotline to the Secret Service and told the Service 's operations center that `` an aircraft [ is ] coming at you and not talking with us . ''
This was the first specific report to the Secret Service of a direct threat to the White House .
No move was made to evacuate the Vice President at this time .
As the officer who took the call explained , `` [ I was ] about to push the alert button when the tower advised that the aircraft was turning south and approaching Reagan National Airport . ''
American 77 began turning south , away from the White House , at 9:34 .
It continued heading south for roughly a minute , before turning west and beginning to circle back .
This news prompted the Secret Service to order the immediate evacuation of the Vice President just before 9:36 .
Agents propelled him out of his chair and told him he had to get to the bunker .
The Vice President entered the underground tunnel leading to the shelter at 9:37 .
Once inside , Vice President Cheney and the agents paused in an area of the tunnel that had a secure phone , a bench , and television .
The Vice President asked to speak to the President , but it took time for the call to be connected .
He learned in the tunnel that the Pentagon had been hit , and he saw television coverage of smoke coming from the building .
The Secret Service logged Mrs . Cheney 's arrival at the White House at 9:52 , and she joined her husband in the tunnel .
According to contemporaneous notes , at 9:55 the Vice President was still on the phone with the President advising that three planes were missing and one had hit the Pentagon .
We believe this is the same call in which the Vice President urged the President not to return to Washington .
After the call ended , Mrs . Cheney and the Vice President moved from the tunnel to the shelter conference room .
United 93 and the Shootdown Order On the morning of 9/11 , the President and Vice President stayed in contact not by an open line of communication but through a series of calls .
The President told us he was frustrated with the poor communications that morning .
He could not reach key officials , including Secretary Rumsfeld , for a period of time .
The line to the White House shelter conference room-and the Vice President- kept cutting off .
The Vice President remembered placing a call to the President just after entering the shelter conference room .
There is conflicting evidence about when the Vice President arrived in the shelter conference room .
We have concluded , from the available evidence , that the Vice President arrived in the room shortly before 10:00 , perhaps at 9:58 .
The Vice President recalled being told , just after his arrival , that the Air Force was trying to establish a combat air patrol over Washington .
The Vice President stated that he called the President to discuss the rules of engagement for the CAP .
He recalled feeling that it did no good to establish the CAP unless the pilots had instructions on whether they were authorized to shoot if the plane would not divert .
He said the President signed off on that concept .
The President said he remembered such a conversation , and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor pilot .
The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft .
The Vice President 's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room , but he did not hear what they said .
Rice , who entered the room shortly after the Vice President and sat next to him , remembered hearing him inform the President , `` Sir , the CAPs are up .
Sir , they 're going to want to know what to do . ''
Then she recalled hearing him say , `` Yes sir . ''
She believed this conversation occurred a few minutes , perhaps five , after they entered the conference room .
We believe this call would have taken place sometime before 10:10 to 10:15 .
Among the sources that reflect other important events of that morning , there is no documentary evidence for this call , but the relevant sources are incomplete .
Others nearby who were taking notes , such as the Vice President 's chief of staff , Scooter Libby , who sat next to him , and Mrs . Cheney , did not note a call between the President and Vice President immediately after the Vice President entered the conference room .
At 10:02 , the communicators in the shelter began receiving reports from the Secret Service of an inbound aircraft-presumably hijacked-heading toward Washington .
That aircraft was United 93 .
The Secret Service was getting this information directly from the FAA .
The FAA may have been tracking the progress of United 93 on a display that showed its projected path to Washington , not its actual radar return .
Thus , the Secret Service was relying on projections and was not aware the plane was already down in Pennsylvania .
At some time between 10:10 and 10:15 , a military aide told the Vice President and others that the aircraft was 80 miles out .
Vice President Cheney was asked for authority to engage the aircraft .
His reaction was described by Scooter Libby as quick and decisive , `` in about the time it takes a batter to decide to swing . ''
The Vice President authorized fighter aircraft to engage the inbound plane .
He told us he based this authorization on his earlier conversation with the President .
The military aide returned a few minutes later , probably between 10:12 and 10:18 , and said the aircraft was 60 miles out .
He again asked for authorization to engage .
The Vice President again said yes .
At the conference room table was White House Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten .
Bolten watched the exchanges and , after what he called `` a quiet moment , '' suggested that the Vice President get in touch with the President and confirm the engage order .
Bolten told us he wanted to make sure the President was told that the Vice President had executed the order .
He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the President .
The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation .
On Air Force One , the President 's press secretary was taking notes ; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20 , the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary .
Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania .
Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization .
At approximately 10:30 , the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane , this time only 5 to 10 miles out .
Believing they had only a minute or two , the Vice President again communicated the authorization to `` engage or `` take out '' the aircraft .
At 10:33 , Hadley told the air threat conference call : `` I need to get word to Dick Myers that our reports are there 's an inbound aircraft flying low 5 miles out .
The Vice President 's guidance was we need to take them out . ''
Once again , there was no immediate information about the fate of the inbound aircraft .
In the apt description of one witness , `` It drops below the radar screen and it 's just continually hovering in your imagination ; you do n't know where it is or what happens to it . ''
Eventually , the shelter received word that the alleged hijacker 5 miles away had been a medevac helicopter .
Transmission of the Authorization from the White House to the Pilots The NMCC learned of United 93 's hijacking at about 10:03 .
At this time the FAA had no contact with the military at the level of national command .
The NMCC learned about United 93 from the White House .
It , in turn , was informed by the Secret Service 's contacts with the FAA .
NORAD had no information either .
At 10:07 , its representative on the air threat conference call stated that NORAD had `` no indication of a hijack heading to DC at this time . ''
Repeatedly between 10:14 and 10:19 , a lieutenant colonel at the White House relayed to the NMCC that the Vice President had confirmed fighters were cleared to engage inbound aircraft if they could verify that the aircraft was hijacked .
The commander of NORAD , General Ralph Eberhart , was en route to the NORAD operations center in Cheyenne Mountain , Colorado , when the shootdown order was communicated on the air threat conference call .
He told us that by the time he arrived , the order had already been passed down NORAD 's chain of command .
It is not clear how the shootdown order was communicated within NORAD .
But we know that at 10:31 , General Larry Arnold instructed his staff to broadcast the following over a NORAD instant messaging system : `` 10:31 Vice president has cleared to us to intercept tracks of interest and shoot them down if they do not respond per [ General Arnold ] . ''
In upstate New York , NEADS personnel first learned of the shootdown order from this message : Floor Leadership : You need to read this. . . .
The Region Commander has declared that we can shoot down aircraft that do not respond to our direction .
Copy that ?
Controllers : Copy that , sir .
Floor Leadership : So if you 're trying to divert somebody and he wo n't divert- Controllers : DO [ Director of Operations ] is saying no .
Floor Leadership : No ? It came over the chat. . . .
You got a conflict on that direction ?
Controllers : Right now no , but- Floor Leadership : Okay ?
Okay , you read that from the Vice President , right ?
Vice President has cleared .
Vice President has cleared us to intercept traffic and shoot them down if they do not respond per [ General Arnold ] .
In interviews with us , NEADS personnel expressed considerable confusion over the nature and effect of the order .
The NEADS commander told us he did not pass along the order because he was unaware of its ramifications .
Both the mission commander and the senior weapons director indicated they did not pass the order to the fighters circling Washington and New York because they were unsure how the pilots would , or should , proceed with this guidance .
In short , while leaders in Washington believed that the fighters above them had been instructed to `` take out '' hostile aircraft , the only orders actually conveyed to the pilots were to `` ID type and tail . ''
In most cases , the chain of command authorizing the use of force runs from the president to the secretary of defense and from the secretary to the combatant commander .
The President apparently spoke to Secretary Rumsfeld for the first time that morning shortly after 10:00 .
No one can recall the content of this conversation , but it was a brief call in which the subject of shootdown authority was not discussed .
At 10:39 , the Vice President updated the Secretary on the air threat conference : Vice President : There 's been at least three instances here where we 've had reports of aircraft approaching Washington -a couple were confirmed hijack .
And , pursuant to the President 's instructions I gave authorization for them to be taken out .
Hello ?
SecDef : Yes , I understand .
Who did you give that direction to ?
Vice President : It was passed from here through the [ operations ] center at the White House , from the [ shelter ] .
SecDef : OK , let me ask the question here .
Has that directive been transmitted to the aircraft ?
Vice President : Yes , it has .
SecDef : So we 've got a couple of aircraft up there that have those instructions at this present time ?
Vice President : That is correct .
And it 's my understanding they 've already taken a couple of aircraft out .
SecDef : We ca n't confirm that .
We 're told that one aircraft is down but we do not have a pilot report that did it .
As this exchange shows , Secretary Rumsfeld was not in the NMCC when the shootdown order was first conveyed .
He went from the parking lot to his office ( where he spoke to the President ) , then to the Executive Support Center , where he participated in the White House video teleconference .
He moved to the NMCC shortly before 10:30 , in order to join Vice Chairman Myers .
Secretary Rumsfeld told us he was just gaining situational awareness when he spoke with the Vice President at 10:39 .
His primary concern was ensuring that the pilots had a clear understanding of their rules of engagement .
The Vice President was mistaken in his belief that shootdown authorization had been passed to the pilots flying at NORAD 's direction .
By 10:45 there was , however , another set of fighters circling Washington that had entirely different rules of engagement .
These fighters , part of the 113th Wing of the District of Columbia Air National Guard , launched out of Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland in response to information passed to them by the Secret Service .
The first of the Andrews fighters was airborne at 10:38 .
General David Wherley -the commander of the 113th Wing -reached out to the Secret Service after hearing secondhand reports that it wanted fighters airborne .
A Secret Service agent had a phone in each ear , one connected to Wherley and the other to a fellow agent at the White House , relaying instructions that the White House agent said he was getting from the Vice President .
The guidance for Wherley was to send up the aircraft , with orders to protect the White House and take out any aircraft that threatened the Capitol .
General Wherley translated this in military terms to flying `` weapons free '' -that is , the decision to shoot rests in the cockpit , or in this case in the cockpit of the lead pilot .
He passed these instructions to the pilots that launched at 10:42 and afterward .
Thus , while the fighter pilots under NORAD direction who had scrambled out of Langley never received any type of engagement order , the Andrews pilots were operating weapons free-a permissive rule of engagement .
The President and the Vice President indicated to us they had not been aware that fighters had been scrambled out of Andrews , at the request of the Secret Service and outside the military chain of command .
There is no evidence that NORAD headquarters or military officials in the NMCC knew-during the morning of September 11- that the Andrews planes were airborne and operating under different rules of engagement .
What If ?
NORAD officials have maintained consistently that had the passengers not caused United 93 to crash , the military would have prevented it from reaching Washington, D.C. That conclusion is based on a version of events that we now know is incorrect .
The Langley fighters were not scrambled in response to United 93 ; NORAD did not have 47 minutes to intercept the flight ; NORAD did not even know the plane was hijacked until after it had crashed .
It is appropriate , therefore , to reconsider whether United 93 would have been intercepted .
Had it not crashed in Pennsylvania at 10:03 , we estimate that United 93 could not have reached Washington any earlier than 10:13 , and probably would have arrived before 10:23 .
There was only one set of fighters circling Washington during that time frame-the Langley F-16s .
They were armed and under NORAD 's control .
After NEADS learned of the hijacking at 10:07 , NORAD would have had from 6 to 16 minutes to locate the flight , receive authorization to shoot it down , and communicate the order to the pilots , who ( in the same span ) would have had to authenticate the order , intercept the flight , and execute the order .
At that point in time , the Langley pilots did not know the threat they were facing , did not know where United 93 was located , and did not have shootdown authorization .
First , the Langley pilots were never briefed about the reason they were scrambled .
As the lead pilot explained , `` I reverted to the Russian threat. . . .
I 'm thinking cruise missile threat from the sea .
You know you look down and see the Pentagon burning and I thought the bastards snuck one by us. . . .
[ Y ] ou could n't see any airplanes , and no one told us anything . ''
The pilots knew their mission was to divert aircraft , but did not know that the threat came from hijacked airliners .
Second , NEADS did not have accurate information on the location of United 93 .
Presumably FAA would have provided such information , but we do not know how long that would have taken , nor how long it would have taken NEADS to locate the target .
Third , NEADS needed orders to pass to the pilots .
At 10:10 , the pilots over Washington were emphatically told , `` negative clearance to shoot . ''
Shootdown authority was first communicated to NEADS at 10:31 .
It is possible that NORAD commanders would have ordered a shootdown in the absence of the authorization communicated by the Vice President , but given the gravity of the decision to shoot down a commercial airliner , and NORAD 's caution that a mistake not be made , we view this possibility as unlikely .
NORAD officials have maintained that they would have intercepted and shot down United 93 .
We are not so sure .
We are sure that the nation owes a debt to the passengers of United 93 .
Their actions saved the lives of countless others , and may have saved either the Capitol or the White House from destruction .
The details of what happened on the morning of September 11 are complex , but they play out a simple theme .
NORAD and the FAA were unprepared for the type of attacks launched against the United States on September 11, 2001 .
They struggled , under difficult circumstances , to improvise a homeland defense against an unprecedented challenge they had never before encountered and had never trained to meet .
At 10:02 that morning , an assistant to the mission crew commander at NORAD 's Northeast Air Defense Sector in Rome , New York , was working with his colleagues on the floor of the command center .
In a brief moment of reflection , he was recorded remarking that `` This is a new type of war . ''
He was , and is , right .
But the conflict did not begin on 9/11 .
It had been publicly declared years earlier , most notably in a declaration faxed early in 1998 to an Arabic-language newspaper in London .
Few Americans had noticed it .

External debt has been virtually eliminated , and the government has accumulated large savings in the oil-stabilization fund ( FRR ) .
The fund was originally proposed by Governor Keith Miller on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale , out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale ( which amounted to $900 million ) at once , and was later championed by Governor Jay Hammond and Kenai state representative Hugh Malone .
It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since , diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund .
The Alaska Constitution was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose .
From its initial principal of $734,000 , the fund has grown to $40 and nbsp ; billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs .
Starting in 1982 , dividends from the fund 's annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible Alaskans , ranging from an initial $1,000.00 in 1982 ( equal to three years ' payout , as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme ) to $3,269.00 in 2008 ( which included a one-time $1,200.00 `` Resource Rebate '' ) .

Says Rothbard , `` Increased hoarding can either come from funds formerly consumed , from funds formerly invested , or from a mixture of both that leaves the old consumption-investment proportion unchanged .
Borrowers , in short , are misled by the bank inflation into believing that the supply of saved funds ( the pool of `` deferred '' funds ready to be invested ) is greater than it really is .
When the pool of `` saved funds '' increases , entrepreneurs invest in `` longer process of production , '' i.e. , the capital structure is lengthened , especially in the `` higher orders '' , most remote from the consumer .
Borrowers take their newly acquired funds and bid up the prices of capital and other producers ' goods , which , in the theory , stimulates a shift of investment from consumer goods to capital goods industries .
Therefore , investments that would not make sense with a 10% cost of funds become feasible with a prevailing interest rate of 5% . many believe investment funds are really available for long term projects when in fact the pool of available funds has come from credit creation - not real savings out of the existing money supply ) because the debasement of the means of exchange is universal , . It is the time when errors are made , when speculative borrowing has driven up prices for assets and capital to unsustainable levels , due to low interest rates `` artificially '' increasing the money supply and triggering an unsustainable injection of fiat money `` funds '' available for investment into the system , thereby tampering with the complex pricing mechanism of the free market .
Several environmental organizations exist in Azerbaijan , yet few funds have been allocated to begin the necessary cleanup and prevention programs .

To make a successful entry into the upper echelons of the Roman political hierarchy , Octavian could not rely on his limited funds .
After a warm welcome by Caesar's soldiers at Brundisium , Octavian demanded a portion of the funds that were allotted by Caesar for the intended war against Parthia in the Middle East .
A later senatorial investigation into the disappearance of the public funds made no action against Octavian , since he subsequently used that money to raise troops against the Senate 's arch enemy , Mark Antony .
On his march to Rome through Italy , Octavian 's presence and newly acquired funds attracted many , winning over Caesar 's former veterans stationed in Campania .

U.S. Congressman Concludes Landmark Visit to Iraq
BAGHDAD , April 20 ( Xinhua ) --
U.S. Democratic Party Congressman Tony Hall left here Thursday after concluding his landmark visit to Iraq , which has been under sweeping U.N. sanctions since 1990 .
In a statement , Hall expressed regret over the negative impacts of the decade-old sanctions on Iraqi people .
During his four-day stay , Hall visited hospitals and health institutions in Baghdad and the southern Muthana Province .
The U.S. lawmaker got acquainted with the sufferings of the Iraqi children because of acute shortage of food and medicine as a direct result of the embargo , reported the Iraqi News Agency ( INA ) .
He also witnessed cases of malnutrition and poliomyelitis that have doubled since 1990 , when U.N. imposed the sanctions against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait , said the INA .
Hall said on Monday that he regretted the miserable humanitarian situation in Iraq while visiting a hospital in the Mansour district of the Iraqi capital .
Iraq has claimed that over 1.2 million people , mostly children and the elderly , have died during the last 10 years , and blames the deaths on shortages of food , medicine and other essential supplies .
Iraq has been accusing the U.S. and Britain of deliberately impeding the implementation of the U.N. oil-for-food deal which allows Baghdad to sell oil under U.N. supervision , thus worsening the humanitarian crisis in Iraq .
Hall 's landmark visit to Iraq started on Sunday evening when he arrived here by land from Amman , Jordan .
Upon arrival , Hall said that his visit , the first of its kind by an American congressman since the 1991 Gulf War , was not political but humanitarian .
`` There are a lot of issues I want to look at , but the issue of humanitarian concerns is number one , '' he said .

Dear Name :
When Jerry was released from prison , he knew it would take hard work and determination to straighten out his life .
He knew he had made a bad mistake , but despite his commitment to rebuilding his life , he just did n't count on the obstacles that would be thrown up in his path .
Reality hit when he was unable to reconcile with his wife and ended up on the street .
He went to the Center Township Trustee for food stamps until he could find a job and a place to live .
The Trustee referred him to the Blue Triangle where he consulted Goodwill 's Career Academy staff for job search assistance .
Jerry 's Goodwill caseworker found him a job immediately .
But Jerry 's troubles did n't end there .
The seasonal construction job he obtained soon ended , and he returned to Career Academy for help once more .
Unemployed , homeless and with a prison record , Jerry now faced going back to prison for failure to pay child support .
It took some time and hard work , but with the help of Goodwill , Jerry was able to work out a payment plan with the prosecutor 's office , find housing and conduct a more thorough job search .
With unemployment at its lowest point in years in central Indiana , many people still have a hard time finding meaningful employment .
Of the more than 42,000 people Goodwill served in 1999 , over 5,000 of them have multiple barriers to finding and keeping a job .
Some , like Jerry , are ex - offenders .
Some are blind , deaf or have other physical disabilities .
More than 100 were homeless .
But Goodwill offers hope even to people with numerous obstacles to overcome , like Jerry .
With a promising new job at a plastic injection molding manufacturer , his legal troubles in check and a safe place to live , Jerry can get on with the business of building a life for himself and contributing to his community .
For as long as he needs it , Goodwill will continue to help .
Your support of Goodwill will provide job training and placement services to help the hardest to serve in central Indiana find meaningful employment .
And , with your assistance , Goodwill can help employers develop resources to keep workers on the job .
Please make an investment in the stability of our community by sending a gift to Goodwill .
Your generosity will help people help themselves .
Sincerely ,
James M. McClelland President
In the long , frightening night after Tuesday 's devastating earthquake , Bay Area residents searched for comfort and solace wherever they could .
Some found it on the screen of a personal computer .
Hundreds of Californians made their way to their computers after the quake , and checked in with each other on electronic bulletin boards , which link computers CB-radio-style , via phone lines .
Some of the most vivid bulletins came over The Well , a Sausalito , Calif. , board that is one of the liveliest outposts of the electronic underground .
About two-thirds of the Well 's 3,000 subscribers live in the Bay Area .
The quake knocked The Well out for six hours , but when it came back up , it teemed with emotional first-hand reports .
Following are excerpts from the electronic traffic that night .
The time is Pacific Daylight Time , and the initials or nicknames are those subscribers use to identify themselves .
11:54 p.m. JCKC : Wow !
I was in the avenues , on the third floor of an old building , and except for my heart ( Beat , BEAT ! ) I 'm OK .
Got back to Bolinas , and everything had fallen : broken poster frames with glass on the floor , file cabinets open or dumped onto the floor .
11:59 p.m. JKD : I was in my favorite watering hole , waiting for the game to start .
I felt the temblor begin and glanced at the table next to mine , smiled that guilty smile and we both mouthed the words , `` Earth-quake ! '' together .
That 's usually how long it takes for the temblors to pass .
This time , it just got stronger and then the building started shaking violently up and down as though it were a child 's toy block that was being tossed .
12:06 a.m. HRH : I was in the Berkeley Main library when it hit .
Endless seconds wondering if those huge windows would buckle and shower us with glass .
Only a few books fell in the reading room .
Then the auto paint shop fire sent an evil-looking cloud of black smoke into the air .
12:07 a.m. ONEZIE : My younger daughter and I are fine .
This building shook like hell and it kept getting stronger .
Except for the gas tank at Hustead 's Towing Service exploding and burning in downtown Berkeley , things here are quite peaceful .
A lot of car alarms went off .
The cats are fine , although nervous .
12:15 a.m. DHAWK : Huge fire from broken gas main in the Marina in SF .
Areas that are made of ` fill ' liquefy .
A woman in a three-story apartment was able to walk out the window of the third floor onto street level after the quake .
The house just settled right down into the ground .
12:38 a.m. DAYAC : I was driving my truck , stopped at a red light at the corner of Shattuck and Alcatraz at the Oakland-Berkeley border when it hit .
Worst part was watching power lines waving above my head and no way to drive away .
12:48 a.m. LMEYER : Was 300 ft. out on a pier in San Rafael .
It flopped all around , real dramatic !
Many hairline cracks in the concrete slabs afterwards .
Ruined the damn fishing !
1:00 a.m. HEYNOW : I rode it out on the second floor of Leo 's at 55th and Telegraph in Oakland .
I heard parts of the building above my head cracking .
I actually thought that I might die .
I could n't decide if I should come home to Marin , because my house is on stilts .
I decided to brave the storm .
There was a horrible smell of gas as I passed the Chevron refinery before crossing the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge .
I could also see the clouds across the bay from the horrible fire in the Marina District of San Francisco .
I have felt many aftershocks .
My back is still in knots and my hands are still shaking .
I think a few of the aftershocks might just be my body shaking .
1:11 a.m. GR8FLRED : I could see the flames from San Francisco from my house across the bay .
It 's hard to believe this really is happening .
1:11 a.m. RD : Building on the corner severely damaged , so an old lady and her very old mother are in the guest room .
Books and software everywhere .
This being typed in a standing position .
1:20 a.m. DGAULT : Bolinas -- astride the San Andreas Fault .
Did n't feel a thing , but noticed some strange bird behavior .
Duck swarms .
3:25 a.m. SAMURAI : I just felt another aftershock a few seconds ago .
I 'm just numb .
3:25 a.m. MACPOST : Downtown Bolinas seems to be the part of town that 's worst off .
No power , minimal phones , and a mess of mayonnaise , wine , and everything else all over the floors of the big old general store and the People 's Co-op .
The quivers move through my house every few minutes at unpredictable intervals , and the mouse that 's been living in my kitchen has taken refuge under my desk .
It runs out frantically now and then , and is clearly pretty distressed .
I was in Stinson Beach when the quake rolled through town .
At first , we were unfazed .
Then as things got rougher , we ran for the door and spent the next few minutes outside watching the brick sidewalk under our feet oozing up and down , and the flowers waving in an eerie rhythm .
Amazing what it does to one 's heart rate and one 's short-term memory .
Everyone looked calm , but there was this surreal low level of confusion as the aftershocks continued .
4:02 a.m. SHIBUMI : Power is back on , and UCSF { medical center } seems to have quieted down for the night ( they were doing triage out in the parking lot from the sound and lights of it ) .
A friend of mine was in an underground computer center in downtown SF when the quake hit .
He said that one of the computers took a three-foot trip sliding across the floor .
Today should be interesting as people realize how hard life is going to be here for a while .
4:30 a.m. KIM : I got home , let the dogs into the house and noticed some sounds above my head , as if someone were walking on the roof , or upstairs .
Then I noticed the car was bouncing up and down as if someone were jumping on it .
I realized what was happening and screamed into the house for the dogs .
Cupboard doors were flying , the trash can in the kitchen walked a few feet , the dogs came running , and I scooted them into the dog run and stood in the doorway myself , watching the outside trash cans dance across the concrete .
When I realized it was over , I went and stood out in front of the house , waiting and praying for Merrill to come home , shivering as if it were 20 below zero until he got there .
Never in my life have I been so frightened .
When I saw the pictures of 880 and the Bay Bridge , I began to cry .
5:09 a.m. JROE : The Sunset { District } was more or less like a pajama party all evening , lots of people & dogs walking around , drinking beer .
6:50 a.m. CAROLG : I was just sitting down to meet with some new therapy clients , a couple , and the building started shaking like crazy .
It 's a flimsy structure , built up on supports , and it was really rocking around .
The three of us stopped breathing for a moment , and then when it kept on coming we lunged for the doorway .
Needless to say , it was an interesting first session !
7:13 a.m. CALLIOPE : Albany escaped embarrassingly unscathed .
Biggest trouble was scared family who could n't get a phone line through , and spent a really horrible hour not knowing .
8:01 a.m. HLR : Judy and I were in our back yard when the lawn started rolling like ocean waves .
We ran into the house to get Mame , but the next tremor threw me in the air and bounced me as I tried to get to my feet .
We are all fine here , although Mame was extremely freaked .
Kitchen full of broken crystal .
Books and tapes all over my room .
Not one thing in the house is where it is supposed to be , but the structure is fine .
While I was standing on the lawn with Mame , waiting for another tremor , I noticed that all the earthworms were emerging from the ground and slithering across the lawn !
9:31 a.m. GR8FLRED : It 's amazing how one second can so completely change your life .
9:38 a.m. FIG : I guess we 're all living very tentatively here , waiting for the expected but dreaded aftershock .
It 's hard to accept that it 's over and only took 15 seconds .
I wonder when we 'll be able to relax .
9:53 a.m. PANDA : Flesh goes to total alert for flight or fight .
Nausea seems a commonplace symptom .
Berkeley very quiet right now .
I walked along Shattuck between Delaware and Cedar at a few minutes before eight this morning .
Next to Chez Panisse a homeless couple , bundled into a blue sleeping bag , sat up , said , `` Good morning '' and then the woman smiled , said , `` Is n't it great just to be alive ? '' I agreed .
It is .
Great .

Dear ,
Do you remember the combination of elation and apprehension you felt when you first left home ?
The young adults who leave Pleasant Run have those same feelings .
Very few have family support to get them started .
Many need furniture , linens and other basic necessities to begin lives on their own .
To help them establish themselves in the community , the Pleasant Run Emancipation fund was begun in 1993 by private donors who wanted to provide a measure of financial support for those leaving our programs .
Individuals who are being emancipated are eligible to receive up to $ 500 from the Fund if they formally apply and meet four requirements .
1 Release by the courts .
2 Successful completion of all life skills tests .
3 Positive termination of his or her Pleasant Run program .
4 Possession of a high school diploma or GED .
Proof of meeting these , two staff reference letters and an essay stating why they should receive a grant and how it will be used are all reviewed by a Pleasant Run panel , which determines if the applicant merits the funds .
Such fund are often used for college tuition , vocational training or a deposit on an apartment .
Because Pleasant Run is the only `` family '' for so many , our Emancipation Fund is one way we can help a young person take the first steps into his or her new life as an independent and productive adult .
Without private donor support , this Fund does n't exist .
Please take a few minutes to send a donation to help one or more of our children successfully cross that threshold into the future .
Sincerely ,
Mary Roth Executive Director

Libya has demonstrated a willingness to use its missile capabilities .
In 1986 , Qadhafi fired two Scuds at a U.S. facility on the Italian island of Lampedusa .
This attack was conducted in retaliation for the U.S. bombing raid on Tripoli , which was carried out in the aftermath of Libyan terrorist activities in Germany .
While the Scuds fell short of Lampedusa , they clearly illustrate how Qadhafi could use longer-range ballistic missiles to target NATO and Western interests in Europe and the Middle East .

Not a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime .
Other Means Of Delivery Available
Land - , sea , and air - launched anti - ship cruise missiles ; air - launched tactical missiles ; none have NBC warheads .
Aircraft ( fighters ) .
Ground systems ( artillery , rocket launchers ) .
Iran is trying to acquire fissile material to support development of nuclear weapons and has set up an elaborate system of military and civilian organizations to support its effort .
Barring outright acquisition of a nuclear weapon from a foreign source , Iran could pursue several other avenues for weapon development .
The shortest route , depending on weapon design , could be to purchase or steal fissile material .
Also , Iran could attempt to produce highly enriched uranium if it acquired the appropriate facilities for the front - end of the nuclear fuel cycle .
Finally , Iran could pursue development of an entire fuel cycle , which would allow for long - term production of plutonium , similar to the route North Korea followed .
Iran does not yet have the necessary infrastructure to support a nuclear weapons program , although is actively negotiating for purchase of technologies and whole facilities to support all of the above strategies .
Iran claims it is trying to establish a complete nuclear fuel cycle to support a civilian energy program , but this same fuel cycle would be applicable to a nuclear weapons development program .
Iran is seeking foreign sources for many elements of the nuclear fuel cycle .
Chinese and Russian supply policies are key to whether Iran will successfully acquire the needed technology , expertise , and infrastructure to manufacture the fissile material for a weapon and the ability to fashion a usable device .
Russian or Chinese supply of nuclear power reactors , allowed by the NPT , could enhance Iran 's limited nuclear infrastructure and advance its nuclear weapons program .
CHEMICAL PROGRAM
Iran has had a chemical weapons production program since early in the Iran - Iraq war .
It used chemical agents to respond to Iraqi chemical attacks on several occasions during that war .
Since the early 1990s , it has put a high priority on its chemical weapons program because of its inability to respond in kind to Iraq 's chemical attacks and the discovery of substantial Iraqi efforts with advanced agents , such as the highly persistent nerve agent VX .
Iran ratified the CWC , under which it will be obligated to eliminate its chemical program over a period of years .
Nevertheless , it continues to upgrade and expand its chemical warfare production infrastructure and munitions arsenal .
Iran manufactures weapons for blister , blood , and choking agents ; it is also believed to be conducting research on nerve agents .
Iran has a stockpile of these weapons , including artillery shells and bombs , which could be used in another conflict in the region .
Although Iran is making a concerted effort to attain an independent production capability for all aspects of its chemical weapons program , it remains dependent on foreign sources for chemical warfare - related technologies .
China is an important supplier of technologies and equipment for Iran 's chemical warfare program .
Therefore , Chinese supply policies will be key to whether Tehran attains its long - term goal of independent production for these weapons .
BIOLOGICAL PROGRAM
Iran 's biological warfare program began during the Iran - Iraq war .
The pace of the program probably has increased because of the 1995 revelations about the scale of Iraqi efforts prior to the Gulf War .
Later in February 2003 , an IAEA delegation visited the pilot - scale gas centrifuge enrichment plant at Natanz , which is nearly ready for operation .
The inspection team learned that Iran has the capability to build more centrifuges .
During the IAEA 's visit to Iran , Iranian officials indicated that Iran would honor its safeguards agreement with the IAEA , but did not clearly indicate Iran 's willingness to accept the Additional Protocol .
This means that Iran will place the Natanz facility , and any enriched uranium it produces , under IAEA inspection but that , as long as no nuclear materials are present , the IAEA would have no ability to examine locations in Iran where it believed nuclear weapons design research might be under way .
The United States is concerned that if Iran stockpiled enriched uranium , it might , in the future , withdraw from the NPT ( as North Korea has ) and then build nuclear weapons rapidly , perhaps even in a matter of months .
It is possible that construction of the Natanz plant violated Iran 's IAEA safeguards obligations .
Such a violation would have occurred if Iran introduced nuclear material into the facility to test it , without informing the IAEA .
Reports in the Western media in March 2003 charged that Iran may have taken this step .
Iran responded by strenuously denying the charges , but also maintained that it reserved the right to possess nuclear weapons to counter Israel 's weaponry .
Biological
There is very little publicly available information to determine whether Iran is pursuing a biological weapon program .
Although Iran acceded to the Geneva Protocol in 1929 and ratified the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention ( BWC ) in 1973 , the U.S. government believes Iran began biological weapon efforts in the early to mid - 1980s , and that it continues to pursue an offensive biological weapon program linked to its civilian biotechnology activities .
The United States alleges that Iran may have started to develop small quantities of agent , possibly including mycotoxins , ricin , and the smallpox virus .
Iran strongly denies acquiring or producing biological weapons .
Chemical
There is limited open - source information available concerning Iran 's chemical weapons program .
Although Iran ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) in November 1997 , the United States believes that Iran has maintained a chemical weapons program since 1984 , including production of sarin , mustard , phosgene , and hydrocyanic acid .
According to U.S. government estimates , Iran can produce 1,000 metric tons of agent per year and may have a stockpile of at least several thousand metric tons of weaponized and bulk agent .
Iran strongly denies acquiring or producing chemical weapons .
Missile Iran possesses one of the largest missile inventories in the Middle East and has acquired complete missile systems and developed an infrastructure to build missiles indigenously .

Abstract:
The article describes the background and recent developments of the Iranian nuclear development program .
US officials confirmed that they have evidence that Iran intends to acquire nuclear weapons .
In October 1991 , the Iranian vice president said that if Israel kept its atomic bombs then Muslims should collectively develop their own .
Iran is a signatory to the NPT and has signed IAEA safeguards agreements .
If suspected sites in Iran could be identified , the IAEA could monitor them .
Reports speculate Iran may be developing centrifuge facilities to enrich uranium at sites such as Moallem Kalayah and Karaj ; however , those providing the reports left during the reign of former Shah Reza Pahlavi .
After Ayatollah Khomeini came to power in 1979 he canceled Iran 's nuclear development program , but it was subsequently resumed .
Many Iranian scientists familiar with uranium enrichment and plutonium manufacturing have returned to Iran after initially fleeing the Khomeini regime .
Iran has hot cells that were supplied by the US in the 1960s .
These hot cells came in combination with a 5 MW research reactor the US sold Iran at the same time .
In 1974 , the Shah bought shares in Eurodif in accordance with a nuclear cooperation agreement with France .
From 1980 to 1990 Iran refused to pay for ar accept delivery of uranium enriched to 3% U-235 processed by Eurodif .
Last year , Iran began requesting supplies of enriched uranium from France and Eurodif .
An Iranian - Eurodif contract for the supply of enriched uranium expired in 1990 .
France later filed suit against Iran .
The suit was settled in late 1991 , but Iran still retains ownership of Eurodif shares .
The French government said it would not allow transfer of enriched uranium to Iran from the French plant .
Following the Gulf War , US media reported that PRC had supplied Iran with a calutron .
Iran had attempted to utilize calutron technology to enrich uranium .
The PRC supplied the calutron with a 27 KW reactor for the Isfahan site .
Small calutrons could be used in the development of larger models ; Iraq had a one - milliamp calutron for both testing and modelling purposes , according to an IAEA inspection report .
Iraq imported calutron magnet cores from Germany .
Since the Gulf crisis , Western governments have urged their industries to refrain from selling enrichment and other nuclear equipment to Iran .
Iranian agents are believed to be actively seeking deals to procure critical technologies .
Iran may have approached Pakistan for help in enriching uranium it purchased from South Africa in the late 1980s .
At the same time , Iraqi officials were claiming Pakistan was helping Iran develop atomic weapons .
Pakistan denied the claims , and was reported to have rejected an Iranian offer to Pakistani former army chief of staff Mirza Aslam Beg to purchase weapons technology .
Some factions within the Pakistani government supported helping Iran .
There have been reports that Iran has acquired unsafeguarded enriched uranium , but US intelligence says there is no evidence that Iran has actually received such material .
Iran may be seeking enriched uranium from Tajikistan .
Tajikistan can manufacture uranium oxide but can not enrich it to levels needed for reactors or weapons .
Tajikistan denies it is trying to export uranium to anyone .
Reports say Iran is working on laser enrichment technologies .
If Iran can adequately demonstrate peaceful intentions for its nuclear program and allows IAEA inspections , nuclear power reactor technology trade restraints may be lifted .

The Argentine firm Investigaciones Aplicadas ( INVAP ) had proposed to sell Iran machine tools , tubing and other equipment , including nuclear reactor material , that could have been used in a nuclear weapons program .
Initially , the Argentine government said the sale could go through if Iran signed a safeguards agreement with the IAEA within forty days .
Consequently , differences have arisen between China and the US over Chinese nuclear exports and assistance to Iran .
There are a number of political , commercial , and bilateral relational issues involved .
Politically , China has sought to establish and improve its relationship with Iran since the 1980s .
China provided huge amounts of weaponry to Iran during the Iran - Iraq in the 1980s .
In recent years Beijing has intended to strengthen its ties with Tehran given the growing importance of the oil - rich Persian Gulf , as China 's reliance on Middle East / Persian Gulf oil increases .
Maintenance and expansion of Sino - Iranian relations naturally constitutes an important component of Chinese strategy in extending its influence to the region .
China wants to maintain and improve its relationship with Iran , especially when there is no persuasive evidence that Iran has used these programs for nuclear weapons development .
Conversely , the US regards Iran as a rogue state that sponsors international terrorism ( including support for terrorists targeting the United States ) and seeks to subvert US allies in the region .
The US fears Iran 's efforts to build nuclear weapons could help give Iran the capability of cutting off the oil from the Persian Gulf .
Related to the different perspectives on Iran , there are also disagreement between the US and China on nuclear transfers and nuclear nonproliferation .
China insists that its nuclear cooperation agreements ( NCA ) with Iran are for peaceful purposes only and that China has pledged to cease all nuclear transfers and/or assistance to foreign nuclear facilities not subject to IAEA inspection .
In addition , since all known Iranian nuclear facilities are under IAEA monitoring , Beijing views US demands that China suspend all its nuclear cooperation programs with Iran as unreasonable and contrary to Article IV of the NPT .
However , the US is concerned with the indirect assistance Iran could receive and is concerned that it is probably covertly seeking the construction of uranium conversion and enrichment facilities , other technical know-how , and technicians .

Launching the Electronics Free Trade Zone in Dubai
Dubai 01-82 ( AFP ) - Crown Prince of Dubai Al Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoom crown prince of Dubai launched today , i.e. on Saturday , an electronics free e-trade zone which has been named `` Dubai Internet City ''
The cost in the first stage of this unique project is estimated at 200 million dollars .

The art of change-ringing is peculiar to the English , and , like most English peculiarities , unintelligible to the rest of the world .
Dorothy L. Sayers , `` The Nine Tailors ''
ASLACTON , England -- Of all scenes that evoke rural England , this is one of the loveliest : An ancient stone church stands amid the fields , the sound of bells cascading from its tower , calling the faithful to evensong .
The parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels stop to chat at the church door , as members here always have .
In the tower , five men and women pull rhythmically on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in 1614 .
But there is also a discordant , modern note in Aslacton , though it ca n't be heard by the church-goers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening .
Like most of the other 6,000 churches in Britain with sets of bells , St. Michael once had its own `` band '' of ringers , who would herald every Sunday morning and evening service .
Now , only one local ringer remains : 64-year-old Derek Hammond .
The others here today live elsewhere .
They belong to a group of 15 ringers -- including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training -- who drive every Sunday from church to church in a sometimes-exhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of East Anglia .
`` To ring for even one service at this tower , we have to scrape , '' says Mr. Hammond , a retired water-authority worker .
`` We 've tried to train the youngsters , but they have their discos and their dances , and they just drift away .
``
Mr. Hammond worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the East Anglian group that keeps the Aslacton bells pealing .
History , after all , is not on his side .
According to a nationwide survey taken a year ago , nearly a third of England 's church bells are no longer rung on Sundays because there is no one to ring them .
It is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes .
The less complicated version of playing tunes on bells , as do the carillons of continental Europe , is considered by the English to be childish , fit only for foreigners .
Change-ringing , a mind-boggling exercise the English invented 380 years ago , requires physical dexterity -- some bells weigh more than a ton -- combined with intense mental concentration .
Proper English bells are started off in `` rounds , '' from the highest-pitched bell to the lowest -- a simple descending scale using , in larger churches , as many as 12 bells .
Then , at a signal , the ringers begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking .
Each variation , or change , can occur only once , the rules state .
Ringers memorize patterns of changes , known as `` methods , '' which have odd-sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters .
A series of 5,000 or so changes is a `` peal '' and takes about three hours .
A look at a Thursday night practice at St. Mary Abbot church in the Kensington district of London gives an idea of the work involved .
Ten shirt-sleeved ringers stand in a circle , one foot ahead of the other in a prize-fighter 's stance , each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber .
No one speaks , and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves , muffled by the ceiling .
Totally absorbed , the ringers stare straight ahead , using peripheral vision ( they call it `` rope-sight '' ) to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls .
Far above in the belfry , the huge bronze bells , mounted on wheels , swing madly through a full 360 degrees , starting and ending , surprisingly , in the inverted , or mouth-up position .
Skilled ringers use their wrists to advance or retard the next swing , so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change .
In a well-known detective-story involving church bells , English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers described ringing as a `` passion { that } finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection .
`` Ringers , she added , are `` filled with the solemn intoxication that comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed .
``
`` Ringing does become a bit of an obsession , '' admits Stephanie Pattenden , master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England 's best female ringers .
It is a passion that usually stays in the tower , however .
More often than not , ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the belfry .
When their changes are completed , and after they have worked up a sweat , ringers often skip off to the local pub , leaving worship for others below .
This does not sit well with some clerics .
With membership of the Church of England steadily dwindling , strong-willed vicars are pressing equally strong-willed and often non-religious ringers to attend services .
Two years ago , the Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone , vicar of Great Torrington , Devon , got so fed up with ringers who did n't attend service he sacked the entire band ; the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest .
`` They were a self-perpetuating club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises , '' the Vicar Hummerstone says .
An entirely new band rings today at Great Torrington , several of whom are members of the congregation .
But there still are n't enough ringers to ring more than six of the eight bells .
At St. Mary 's Church in Ilminster , Somerset , the bells have fallen silent following a dust-up over church attendance .
The vicar , W.D. Jones , refuses to talk about it , saying it would `` reopen the wound .
`` But C.J.B. Marshall , vicar of a nearby church , feels the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that are located next to the altar .
`` So crunch , crunch , crunch , bang , bang , bang -- here come the ringers from above , making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer , '' he says .
Vicar Marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue , since he is both a vicar and an active bell-ringer himself .
`` The sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church , '' he says .
`` I live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that fuller life .
``
The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers , a sort of parliament of ringing groups , aims to improve relations with vicars , says John C. Baldwin , president .
It hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled , `` The Bells in Your Care .
`` Says Mr. Baldwin , `` We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience .
``
Mr. Baldwin is also attacking the greater problem : lack of ringers .
One survey says that of the 100,000 trained bellringers in England today , only 40,000 of them still ring .
Also , ringers do n't always live where the bells need to be rung -- like in small , rural parishes and inner-city churches .
But the council 's program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful , says Mr. Baldwin .
`` Right now , we 're lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of 10 , '' he adds .
One bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male-dominated field ; more than a third of the ringers today are women .
They are n't accepted everywhere , however .
The oldest bell-ringing group in the country , the Ancient Society of College Youths , founded in 1637 , remains male-only , a fact that 's particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for Britain 's most prestigious churches , St. Paul 's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey .
This being Britain , no woman has filed an equal-opportunity suit , but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to `` The Ringing World , '' a weekly newspaper for ringers .
One writer , signing his letter as `` Red-blooded , balanced male , '' remarked on the `` frequency of women fainting in peals , '' and suggested that they `` settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings .
``
In the torrent of replies that followed , one woman ringer from Solihull observed that `` the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be desired : badly dressed , decorated with acne and a large beer-belly , frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals .
`` Another women wrote from Sheffield to say that in her 60 years of ringing , `` I have never known a lady to faint in the belfry .
I have seen one or two men die , bless them .
``
Jamaica and Its People
The island of Jamaica will be near the top of the list for anyone planning an idyllic holiday getaway .
With warm sunshine , beautiful beaches , lush tropical scenery , and fine hotels , it is guaranteed to provide a little rest and relaxation .
However , with a vibrant grassroots culture and the growing confidence of an independent nation , it defies the advertising stereotype of the deserted island .
Jamaica is not just a destination it is an experience .
The third - largest island in the Caribbean , just south of Cuba , Jamaica is 233 km ( 145 miles ) in length and 83 km ( 52 miles ) across at its widest point .
The island is aligned almost east - to - west in the water so that sunrise wakes the eastern tip , proceeds to caress the length of the island , and kisses the western tip good night .
Geographically it is extremely diverse , with a central backbone of high mountains and hills blanketed with tropical rain-forest .
These are surrounded by areas of limestone formations , scrub and grassland , coral cliffs , and fine sand beaches .
Fresh water from tropical storms feeds 120 rivers and some of the most celebrated waterfalls and cascades on earth .
On land , there is a wealth of animal and bird life .
Rare species of butterflies and delicate hummingbirds take to the air , and crocodiles and manatees still live in and around vast tracts of mangrove swamp in the south .
The island is surrounded by coral reefs and reef walls , which provide shelter to hundreds of species of sea creatures and recreation to divers and snorkelers .
Temperatures here vary only a few degrees from about 27 C ( 80 F ) , although the heat is tempered by the nearly continuous trade winds that blow across the Atlantic .
In the mountains and hills of the interior , the temperature drops with altitude and with the clouds that wrap around the highest peaks .
Much of the land is extremely fertile and produces a range of tropical fruit and vegetable crops , providing ample food for the people and such lucrative cash crops as sugar and coffee .
Four hundred years ago these crops brought British colonists to rule the land and African slaves to work it .
The bitter taste of slavery is always in the background .
Today Jamaican population is a mixture of African and English , with Spanish , Indian , and a smattering of Portuguese Jews , Germans , Welsh , and Scots .
They have been melded together , giving rise to a fascinating national identity .
Since independence in 1962 , the black majority has worked to create a country based on confidence from within , working on a principle of pride in oneself and in one 's roots .
This is so important for the future of the country that the national motto is `` Out of many one people . ''
It says much about the character of the Jamaican people that they have slightly changed the story of Columbus and his trip to the island in 1493 .
He is not held in the same high esteem here as he is in other islands .
As someone has said , Columbus only thought that he had discovered Jamaica .
In actuality , it was the population of Jamaica who discovered him Columbus was really lost , thinking that he had found another route to Asia .
Vestiges of the British colonial legacy can still be found , not least in the fact that English is Jamaica 's official language : the popularity of cricket is another example .
The thirteen regional parishes and numerous towns were originally named after British settlements .
You can find Manchester , Sheffield , and Cambridge in Jamaica , to name but three .
However , these British influences have , even from the earliest days of colonial rule , always been tempered and molded to the Jamaican style .
Jamaica has always had a second , unofficial language developed from the early days of slavery .
This creole , a mixture of English , African , and Spanish words and phrases , is still evolving and often indecipherable to the outsider .
Next to town names derived from England , you also find names such as Wait Awhile and Fruitful Vale , derived from the function and activity of the everyday lives of ordinary Jamaicans .
And as far as cricket is concerned , Caribbean players have turned the tables on their colonial mentors and now produce some of the best players in the world , easily capable of soundly outplaying the Brits .
In recent years the influence of the United States has been much stronger than that of Britain .
Many Jamaicans head to the States for further education , and the American economic influence on areas such as business investment and planning is growing .
Its no surprise that the US dollar is accepted as readily as the Jamaican dollar to pay for goods .
But Jamaica is not simply turning blindly into a small version of its bigger brother .
It still revels in its own identity , which is now internationally recognized through such influential cultural products as the Rastafarian religion and reggae music .
The followers of Rastafarianism ( with their characteristic mane of dreadlocks ) originated in Jamaica in the 1930s and are still predominantly found here .
Jamaican music ska -- and , especially , reggae -- has since the 1970s been exported and enjoyed around the world .
The strong beat and earthy lyrics seem to symbolize and celebrate the character of this young and lively country .
Jamaicans are sociable people , living their lives out in the open and knowing everything about their neighbor business .
There 's nothing they like better than having a good chat about the latest bit of gossip : who is doing what , where , and why .
They are very direct in their dealings with each other , as you might discover if you come across a friendly conversation among a group of friends .
The loud , raucous Jamaican English dialect and the waving hands reflect the joy with which social relations are conducted here .
They are equally direct in their dealings with visitors , too , so do n't expect a shy Jamaican smile as you walk by .
Instead , be prepared for a barrage of questions about your life , offers to supply anything you need , a host of jokes at your expense , and some serious flirting if you 're single .
Jamaicans can definitely be in your face .
But do n't feel intimidated , as their attitude is not personal .
Having some lines ready to throw back at them induces guffaws of laughter and an appreciative slap on the back .
The recreational pleasures that ordinary islanders enjoy have become synonymous with the name Jamaica : dancing to the heavily rhythmic musical beat ; taking a little marijuana ( or `` ganja , '' as it 's known here ) , which many Jamaicans view as a kind of medicinal herb ; or simply sitting back and chatting with friends on a bench or street corner , where the situation is described as `` Irie '' the equivalent of `` Everything 's just fine ! ''
Jamaicans appear to worry little about the future ; sometimes it seems that they worry little even about what happens in the next few minutes .
The popular phrase `` Soon come '' indicates an apparent lack of concern about time and an unhurried attitude to daily tasks .
Occasional hurricanes can spoil the idyllic climate and contribute to this `` laid back '' attitude : Jamaicans are aware that circumstances can suddenly alter dramatically and yet life will always carry on .
To have to wait a while for something is not the worst problem in the world .
Since independence in 1962 , tourism has been Jamaica 's primary industry and the island has become renowned as one of the prime destinations in the Caribbean .
The best beaches have become home to the finest hotels , which supply almost everything needed for the perfect vacation .
All-inclusive packages and large resort hotels offer restaurants , sporting activities , entertainment , wide - screen sports channels in the bars , shopping , and a guaranteed suntan .
There is frequently a temptation never to tear oneself away from the hotel .
Yet to do this is to miss the very essence of what the island is all about .
Step out of the hotel and your senses will be bombarded by a range of sights , sounds , smells , tastes , and textures that let you know that you could only be in Jamaica .
Such sights include the colorful `` tams '' -- knitted hats worn by Jamaican men to cover their mane of dreadlocks -- and the red ackee fruit that ripens at the beginning of the year .
Sample the taste of ackee cooked with saltfish , Jamaica 's national dish , and the smell of hot jerk pork cooked in a pit barbecue .
Hear the songs of Bob Marley booming from a hundred cranked - up car stereos or the chorus of frogs that begin to call as evening descends .
Feel the texture of a hand offered in greeting and try to fathom the `` Jamaican handshake , '' a ritual whose rules seem to be more complex than those of the game of cricket .
Of course Jamaica has its palm - lined beaches and almost endless rum drinks , and you can enjoy a wonderful resort - based break .
But once you begin to look underneath this initial veneer of a `` do - nothing - in - the - tropics '' holiday , it 's like peeling the layers of an onion .
There 's an abundance of nature , history , art , and modern culture to be explored and enjoyed .
Jamaica is an island with a strong personality that does n't simply wait in the wings .
It comes out to meet you .
Kofi Annan , the Secretary-General of the United Nations , recently called attention to the clear inequalities in science between developing and developed countries and to the challenges of building bridges across these gaps that should bring the United Nations and the world scientific community closer to each other ( Annan 2003 ) .
Mr . Annan stressed the importance of reducing the inequalities in science between developed and developing countries , asserting that “This unbalanced distribution of scientific activity generates serious problems not only for the scientific community in the developing countries , but for development itself . ” Indeed , Mr . Annan 's sentiments have also been echoed recently by several scientists , who present overwhelming evidence for the disparity in scientific output between the developing and already developed countries ( Gibbs 1995 ; May 1997 ; Goldemberg 1998 ; Riddoch 2000 ) .
For example , recent United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) estimates ( UNESCO 2001 ) indicate that , in 1997 , the developed countries accounted for some 84% of the global investment in scientific research and development , had approximately 72% of the world researchers , and produced approximately 88% of all scientific and technical publications registered by the Science Citation Index ( SCI ) .
North America and Europe clearly dominate the number of scientific publications produced annually , with 36.6% and 37.5% , respectively , worldwide ( UNESCO 2001 ) .
North America and Europe clearly dominate the number of scientific publications produced annually .
It is rather obvious that richer countries are able to invest more resources in science and therefore account for the largest number of publications .
It is also likely that there is a statistical bias on the part of the SCI as a bibliometric database , since it represents North American and European publications far better than those of the rest of the world ( Gibbs 1995 ; May 1997 ; Alonso and Fernández-Juricic 2001 ; Vohora and Vohora 2001 ) .
But is the disparity in scientific contributions between the developed and developing worlds actually remaining unchanged or even increasing , as Mr . Annan has implied ?
A closer look at the trends over the last decade reveals important advances in developing countries .
For example , Latin America and China , although representing , respectively , only 1.8% and 2% of scientific publications worldwide , have increased the number of their publications between 1990 and 1997 by 36% and 70% , respectively , which is a much higher percentage than the increments reached by Europe ( 10% ) and industrial Asia ( 26% ) .
The percentage of global scientific publications from North America actually decreased by 8% over the same period ( UNESCO 2001 ) .
Publishing Trends in the Americas
Using the SCI databases produced by the Institute for Scientific Information ( ISI ) , as well as data compiled by the Red Iberoamericana de Indicadores de Ciencia y Tecnología ( RICYT ) , we examined the differences in the number and proportion of scientific publications between the developed world and the developing world from 1990 until 2000 , focusing on the Americas as a case study .
Not surprisingly , there was a huge disparity in the number of publications from 1990 until 2000 , with the United States contributing the lion 's share ( 84.2% ) , followed by Canada ( 10.35% ) .
Latin America as a whole contributed only 5.45% to the total number of scientific publications in these ten years ( RICYT 2002 ) .
The total number of publications , however , is not necessarily the best measure for assessing scientific productivity or technical advances ( May 1997 ) .
More relevant measurements for these factors include the proportional change in the number of publications and the total number of publications when corrected for investment in research and development ( May 1997 ) .
The proportional change in the number of publications , using 1990 as a comparison , revealed that scientific publishing in Latin America increased the most rapidly in the Americas , far outpacing the United States and Canada ( Figure 1 ) .
Further analyses , correcting the number of overall publications for the amount of money invested in research and development for each region , also show that , in contrast to both Canada and United States , the trend in Latin America has been an increase in relative output throughout the 1990s ( Figure 2 ) .
Moreover , when taking into account the amount of research money available to researchers , Latin America actually out-published the United States and Canada by the year 2000 ( Figure 2 ) .
Although the cost of research is undoubtedly cheaper in the developing world due to relatively low researcher salaries , overhead and other work standards , these factors do not explain the substantial increase in the number of publications per amount of money allocated to research and development in Latin America , particularly from 1995 until 2000 ( Figure 2 ) .
Other relative indicators of scientific productivity , such as the number of publications picked up by the SCI in relation to the number of scientists in a particular country , also demonstrate that such developing regions as Latin America are making substantial contributions to science , despite the fact that the average proportion of gross domestic product ( GDP ) invested in science in Latin America throughout this 10 - year period was only 21% of the amount invested in United States ( RICYT 2002 ) .
Indeed , this scientific productivity is remarkable when we compare it with the relatively low investment in science itself as compared with the GDP of Latin America as a whole .
In fact , Albornoz ( 2001 ) concluded that , as a group , Latin America could afford to invest a much higher proportion of its resources in scientific research and development .
Latin American investment in research and development represented only 0.59% of the regional GDP in 1998 , a very weak effort compared with that of the United States ( 2.84% ) and Canada ( 1.5% ) .
Among Latin American countries , there is a high degree of variability in publication rate as well as in financial investment in science and technology .
Some countries have performed particularly well .
For example , Uruguay , Chile , Panama , and Cuba averaged , respectively , 6.8 , 5.3 , 5.2 , and 3.4 publications per million dollars of research and development investment in the 10 years studied , which is notoriously high compared with United States ( 1.5 ) and even Canada ( 3.3 ) ( RICYT 2002 ) .
Other countries , such as Costa Rica , Cuba , Brazil , and Chile , have invested a much greater proportion of their GDP in research and development than the other countries of this region ( Albornoz 2001 ) .
Why has the number of publications per dollar invested in research and development been increasing in Latin America while decreasing in United States and Canada ?
Explaining the Increase in Publishing Productivity in Latin America
One potential explanation for the increase in scientific productivity in Latin America is that scientific development during the 1990s was particularly strong for many countries of this region .
Chemical Overview
This assessment ranks North Korea among the largest possessors of chemical weaponry in the world .
If official reports and testimonies from North Korean defectors are to be believed , the DPRK military possesses between 2,500 and 5,000 tons of chemical weapons .
It is not clear , however , if this amount includes the munitions or only the CW agents themselves .
Reportedly , the CW agents in the DPRK arsenal include all of the major classes , such as phosgene ( choking ) , hydrogen cyanide ( blood ) , mustard ( blister ) and sarin ( nerve agent ) .
However , a 2002 report from the commander of U.S. Forces in Korea , General Thomas A. Schwartz , also suggests that North Korea is self - sufficient only in World War I era CW agents -- these would include compounds such as phosgene , Lewisite , and mustard blister agents , but not the more potent nerve agent classes .
During the three decades after the establishment of the DPRK ( in 1947 ) , the North Korean CW program had uneven success in obtaining and weaponizing CW agents .
However , it would appear that over the last 20 years , the DPRK has increased its capacity not only in CW agent production but also the development and deployment of a variety of chemical delivery systems .
According to defector accounts , the DPRK 's long - range missiles such as the Nodong , and other ballistic rockets and artillery pieces with calibres larger than 80 mm , are capable of delivering CW agents .
Despite North Korea 's moribund economy and some hints of softening rhetoric from its leadership , the quantity and quality of new artillery placed near the Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) have actually increased in the last several years .
Many of these artillery platforms , including multiple launch rocket systems ( MLRS ) of up to 320 mm , are forwardly deployed near the DMZ .
This deployment represents a significant threat to heavily populated Seoul , as well as to the entire peninsula in the event of a southward invasion by the Korean People's Army ( KPA ) .
Background
As early as 1947 , the KPA manual addressed at least the theory of CW operational doctrine .
It noted the utility of forcing the enemy to `` suit up '' in preparation for real or imagined use of chemical agents , for doing so would degrade the fighting ability of enemy forces .
By 1954 , the KPA established nuclear , biological , and chemical ( NBC ) defense units , probably along the lines of the Soviet model .
According to some accounts , North Korea 's offensive CW program also began at this time , relying mostly on Chinese assistance for chemical weapons development .
Kim Il Sung 's `` Declaration for Chemicalization '' in 1961 called for the further development of a chemical industry to support chemical weapons production , and the basic organization of the current Nuclear and Chemical Defense Bureau ( NCDB ) was also established during this time .
In 1966 , for reasons that are unclear , the DPRK later turned to the Soviets for assistance in CW , mostly in the form of training manuals and small quantities of nerve and mustard agents .
Following this period of Soviet - led assistance , North Korea made substantive gains in the area of chemical warfare .
Still , the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) estimated in May 1979 that North Korea had only a defensive capability in CW , while noting that its development of offensive chemical weapons would have been the next logical step .
Finally , by the late 1980s , it was reported that North Korea was able to produce CW agents in large quantity , and deployed large numbers of chemical ordnance .
In January 1987 , the South Korean defense ministry told the South Korean press that the DPRK possessed up to 250 tons of chemical weapons , including blister ( mustard ) and nerve agents .
Recent estimates of North Korean chemical ordnance by the South Korean Ministry of National Defense ( MND ) have since been raised to the thousands of tons , probably based on recent information provided by North Korean defectors , including former members of DPRK military and NBC defence organizations .
The Suspected North Korean Chemical Weapons Arsenal
The DPRK is believed to maintain 2,500 to 5,000 tons of chemical agents , primarily mustard , phosgene , sarin , and V - series nerve agents. ( Other reports from DPRK defectors -- including allegations of a `` nitrogen , sulfur , and mercury '' chemical weapon that causes `` respiratory paralysis '' -- seem rather farfetched . ) Pak Tong Sam at the South Korean Agency for Defense Development has estimated that North Korea 's chemical weapons production capability is 4,500 tons annually in peacetime , and this could increase to 12,000 tons in wartime .
An unknown portion of CW agents are stored in bulk , but a significant portion is reported to be filled into artillery shells and rocket warheads .
Due to challenges posed by a limited source of indigenously produced precursors for CW agents , it is believed that North Korea emphasizes production of phosgene , mustard , sarin , and V - agents. ( Previous reports have also alleged a large stock of sarin nerve agent. ) In 2001 , it was estimated that there are 12 facilities in the DPRK where raw chemicals , precursors , and CW agents are produced and / or stored .
CW agents are then moved to either a Sakchu - or Kanggye - based chemical weapons facility for weaponization , i.e. , the filling of weapons with agents for deployment .
It is also reported that shipments of CW agents are conducted in such a way so as not to attract undue attention , and are camouflaged as ordinary military cargo .
CW Agents
Open - source assessments of North Korean chemical weapons stockpiles have changed significantly over the past decade .
Reports by defectors and other accounts in the open literature indicate that North Korea currently possesses blister ( e.g. , mustard ) , nerve ( e.g. , sarin ) , choking ( e.g. , phosgene ) , and blood agents ( e.g. , hydrogen cyanide ) .
A North Korean defector in 1997 told a U.S. Congressional committee that the DPRK possessed a blister agent called `` Lizut , '' or Lewisite , in its arsenal .
VE and VG nerve agents are also mentioned in South Korean assessments of DPRK chemical weapons , although these reports do not appear to be based on hard data but rather on inference .
A 1999 report by the U.S. Congress stated the following with regard to how the North Korean military views chemical weaponry :
Reflecting Soviet military doctrine , the DPRK has traditionally viewed chemical weapons as an integral part of any military offensive .
There are no indications that this view has altered since the end of the Cold War .
The most obvious tactical use of chemical weapons by the DPRK would be to terrorize South Korean civilians .
Seoul lies within easy striking distance of North Korea 's artillery and rocket systems and , today , the South Korean civilian population has no protection against CW attack .
Delivery Systems
Over half of North Korea 's 1.2 million - man army is deployed within 90 miles of the DMZ , as are thousands of artillery systems .
Because chemical weapons are best suited for delivery with larger caliber artillery pieces , it is worth noting that over the last two years the North has further increased the number of long - range 240 mm multiple rocket launcher systems and 170 mm howitzers , all placed in hardened sites near the DMZ .
North Korea 's chemical defense force is estimated to be around 13,000 personnel , probably making it the third - largest CW service in the world , with chemical defense units incorporated at the regimental level .
The Hamhung Chemical Engineering College is responsible for much of the training of the Korean People's Army in CW defense .
Two main factories located in the cities of Kanggye and Sakchu are reportedly tasked with the final preparation , filling , and distribution of CW agents in artillery shells from 80 mm and larger , as well as 240 mm caliber artillery rockets .
Testing of agents is also reportedly performed at these two locations , possibly in very large underground facilities .
In addition to thousands of artillery rounds , hundreds of forward deployed Scud-B , Frog-5 and Frog-7 missiles , plus about 30 Scud-C missiles could be armed with chemical warheads .
All of them could easily strike much of South Korea .
A South Korean security analyst suggested that DPRK artillery pieces of calibers 170 mm and 240 mm `` could fire 10,000 rounds per minute to Seoul and its environs . ''
Given all of North Korea 's artillery along on the DMZ , it has been estimated that the KPA could fire over 5 million artillery shells per hour .
Status
In 1994 , during heightened tensions over North Korea 's nuclear weapons program , the DPRK threatened to turn Seoul into a `` sea of fire . ''
One of the highest ranking North Korean government officials to defect to the South , Hwang Jang Yop , said in April 1997 that the DPRK military was able to do just that , using a combination of chemical and nuclear weapons delivered by missiles .
Rhetoric aside , North Korea faces many obstacles in actually employing CW agents , not to mention their manufacture and storage .
To be sure , the wide availability of oil - derived intermediates , especially ethylene oxide , makes the large - scale manufacture of simple CW agents such as mustard well within the capabilities of the DPRK .
However , it is not clear how well North Korea would be able to manufacture large quantities of nerve agents , such as sarin , soman , and VX , without putting a great burden on already limited resources .
During the 1990s , the unavailability of precursors required to manufacture some nerve agents may very well have challenged the DPRK logistical supply network .
For example , in 1996 an ethnic Korean in Japan was caught exporting 50 kg of sodium fluoride to North Korea by way of cargo vessels bringing food aid to the DPRK .
Ostensibly , this chemical was intended for use by a North Korean entity for electroplating purposes .
But because sodium fluoride is also a precursor for sarin and soman nerve agents , the Japanese authorities arrested the individual ( himself a Japanese citizen ) for trading in a controlled substance .
The relatively small amount ( 50kg ) of this chemical had little consequence in terms of producing militarily significant amounts of nerve agent .
But the sodium fluoride episode points to a serious problem faced by North Korea , namely the lack of domestically - manufactured chemical precursors .
Nonetheless , the DPRK has also shown a single-minded emphasis on buttressing its military capabilities despite a poverty - stricken economy and populace .
Although the majority of the CW stockpile in the North may not be of the more sophisticated and lethal nerve agent variety , it may contain a large quantity of casualty agents such as mustard , phosgene , and Lewisite , all compounds that are relatively easy to manufacture .
North Korea and the Chemical Weapons Convention
In the early 1990s -- according to reports from DPRK defectors -- the North Korean Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces debated over whether to join the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) .
Although the foreign ministry was apparently in favor of participating in the regime , the military was opposed , and Kim Chong Il apparently sided with the latter .
Since 1997 , the South Korean government has insisted that the DPRK join the CWC , to no avail .
North Korea has also rebuffed efforts on the part of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) , as well as the Japanese government , to persuade it to participate in the chemical disarmament regime .
If North Korea wishes to foster a viable chemical industry , a case could be made that its accession to the CWC would make long - term economic sense by giving it access to trade in treaty - controlled chemicals and technology .
In the short term , however , a knowledgeable official at the OPCW noted that North Korea would not reap immediate benefits by joining the CWC regime .
The Entrepreneur Is the New Madonna
Dear Joe ,
I know what you mean about being a journalist .
Almost every assignment is a challenge in a different way and it never seems to get easier .
I often feel as if I only get half the story sometimes , so I typically do a massive amount of reporting that is most often much more than I will ever need .
I think that is why I welcomed doing a book -- it gives one the ability to use so much of what is left on the cutting room floor of daily journalism .
Think of all the good stuff we all collect daily in our reporting that we never add to stories .
Most often reporters recount these tales with each other and with their sources rather than share them with the general public .
Much of it , of course , using the standards of top newspapers , can not be used since it is largely gossip we are repeating , although it certainly could make for some very good stories .
I often wonder when a really great fictional book will be written about this era ( probably decades and decades hence as it is too close ) .
In any case , there certainly is no lack of information available about the moguls of technology now as they all become our current pop icons .
I would posit that Bill and Michael and Steve and Jerry have become the Madonnas of the current age of stock market mania and celebration of the entrepreneur .
So the shift in the image of Gates has been an interesting one for me to watch .
The smart-boy technologist is now being painted as the whiny bully .
I personally always thought it was a risk to pin the image of Microsoft on just one man -- at AOL , for example , there was a conscious effort to develop other `` characters , '' for lack of a better word .
So there , while you think of Case , you also think of Pittman and Leonsis and increasingly a range of other executives .
Steve Ballmer , of course , is now getting a lot more attention at Microsoft , but it still seems to be Bill 's show over there .
While I did not attend the trial -- I was lucky to be able to read your highly amusing and informative dispatches , several of which made me spit up my lunch laughing -- it certainly seemed as if the image of Bill Gates took a beating and the insular culture of Microsoft did not look so good .
That 's ironic , since I think it was just that insularity that helped them , much in the same way that AOL has benefited from being in the Virginia suburbs rather than in Silicon Valley .
AOL would never have existed if it had been founded here , I am sure , since its employees would have been mocked into obscurity by the digerati .
Out in the D.C. area , they looked positively exciting next to all the government-oriented contractors .
I wonder if that means geography is destiny , and it 's still location , location , location .
From where I am sitting , I think the Microsoft trial has been the really obvious turning point between the computer era and the digital age .
I think it almost does not matter what the judge does since it 's clear that the balance of power is shifting again , although it not clear where it will land .
Will the strongman of the era be AOL , AT and T , Microsoft , or one of the big media companies ?
Or will it be none of them because the Internet allows and encourages a plethora of strong companies and a complex interconnection of businesses where none are allowed to dominate ?
I always use two simple words when people tell me that one company -- whether it is AOL or Microsoft or Disney -- is in charge of all our destinies : Babylon was .
That incredible empire dominated the world and I imagine it did not seem possible to people living then that anyone could loosen that empire 's grip on humanity .
But we all know how that story turned out .
Now I am getting way too philosophical , but this is my final missive , so why not ?
Perhaps you could hasten a prediction of where this is all going .
As for me , I 'll stick with my philosophy of reporting and , I guess , life -- nobody knows .
Cheers , Kara
Example 4
JOHANNESBURG - After four days in the hospital battling a lung infection , former President Nelson Mandela of South Africa `` is responding better to treatment , '' President Jacob Zuma told Parliament in Cape Town on Wednesday .
'' We are very happy with the progress that he 's now making , following a difficult few days , '' Zuma said .
It was the first report of an improvement in Mandela 's condition since he was admitted to a hospital in Pretoria early Saturday after suffering a recurrence of a persistent lung ailment , a legacy of the tuberculosis he contracted during the 27 years he was imprisoned for opposing apartheid .
His health has been frail lately , and this hospitalization was his fourth in the last seven months .
( NYT_ENG _20130625.0044 ) Meanwhile , in Pretoria , doctors continued to treat Mandela for a lung ailment that he contracted on Robben Island , the notorious apartheid-era prison where he spent much of his 27 years behind bars until his release in 1990 .
He was hospitalized June 8 , his fourth hospitalization since late last year .
In a statement , President Jacob Zuma said Mandela 's condition was unchanged .
On Sunday , he visited Mandela and pronounced that his state had deteriorated from stable to critical .

The renewed investigation of Morsi and members of the Muslim Brotherhood dates to the uprising that led to the ouster of Mubarak in 2011 .
Morsi and other Brotherhood leaders were arrested Jan. 28 and held in the Wadi Natroun prison north of Cairo , until they escaped two days later .
The case languished after Morsi was elected last year in the country 's first free presidential race , although local news outlets and Morsi 's opponents accused militants from Hamas , the Brotherhood 's Palestinian offshoot , of freeing their colleagues .
Nuclear Capabilities
Methodology
Countries developing clandestine nuclear weapons programs usually go to great lengths to conceal information about these programs from the outside world .
Therefore , obtaining reliable open source information on such programs is very challenging .
The lack of reliable information typically results in substantial uncertainty about the size and capabilities of these clandestine programs .
Nonetheless , countries suspected of having clandestine nuclear weapons programs are the subject of intense scrutiny by nonproliferation analysts , intelligence agencies , and other observers .
Gradually , a fuzzy picture emerges from the analysis , albeit with some gaps in understanding .
The resulting analysis can set bounds on the uncertainties , while producing a range of estimates of the country 's capabilities .
Analytic tools include examining statements and articles in the news media , government reports including unclassified intelligence estimates , interviewing insiders who have had access to information about the clandestine program , reviewing secondary sources such as reports by analysts , and making scientific calculations based on the best available information about a country 's nuclear infrastructure .
Technical analysis of clandestine programs is based on the widely known physical and engineering aspects of nuclear materials and weapons , which enable estimates of capabilities based on fragmentary and uncertain information , as follows .
Nuclear weapons programs require specialized materials , facilities , equipment , and training in order to produce the raw material for weapons -- either highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) or plutonium -- and then to fabricate explosive devices using this fissile material .
Weapons programs can be based on indigenous ( i.e. , domestic ) production capabilities , or they can rely on foreign supplies and technologies .
Virtually all weapons programs use some foreign inputs , if only technical information culled from scientific and engineering sources .
However , all countries known to have successfully acquired nuclear weapons have done so primarily on the basis of indigenously produced fissile material .
A plutonium - based bomb program requires capabilities to mine and mill uranium , process it into reactor fuel , transform the isotopic content of the fuel by `` burning '' it in a reactor , extract plutonium from the spent fuel , form the plutonium into the core of a fission - implosion weapon , and develop and test high explosives used to initiate fission .
Although technically sub - optimal , even reactor - grade plutonium can be used as fissile material in nuclear weapons .
A uranium - based bomb program requires capabilities to mine and mill uranium , and to enrich it to weapons - grade or near - weapons - grade ( the Hiroshima bomb used less - than - weapons - grade uranium ) .
An advanced weapons program would require the capability to manufacture tritium , a radioactive gas that can be used to enhance the explosive power of nuclear weapons , for fabrication of boosted - yield weapons .
While countries may seek to develop all of these capabilities on an independent , indigenous basis , they can and often do seek some inputs from foreign sources .
For example , they may purchase raw or milled uranium ore from abroad , and then use indigenous facilities to enrich it to weapons - grade material .
Determining how many nuclear weapons a country can produce with a given amount of fissile material requires knowing the technological sophistication of the country and the explosive yield of the weapons .
These specifications in North Korea are unknown .
Based on data supplied by the de jure nuclear weapons states , the IAEA Safeguards Division defines quantities of concern as 8kg of plutonium and 25kg of HEU .
However , sophisticated nuclear weapons reportedly use as little as 3 - 4kg of plutonium and/or 15 - 20kg of HEU .
The Natural Resources Defense Council has estimated that a country with a `` high technical capability '' could require as little as 1kg of weapons - grade plutonium or 2.5kg HEU to produce a one kiloton bomb .
The atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki used low - level nuclear weapons technology .
The Hiroshima bomb , for example , employed about 50kg of 80% enriched uranium .
In the case of North Korea , determining the status of its nuclear weapons program is especially difficult .
As an extremely isolated and secretive state , North Korea provides few signals of the existence -- let alone the extent -- of its nuclear weapons program .
Key data sources for DPRK include defector testimony , which may be unreliable given possibility of deliberate disinformation by double agents and defectors exaggerating what they know , and unclassified estimates by US intelligence agencies , which may have certain biases based on national interest , worst - case expectations , domestic politics , etc. Also , most estimates do not rely on original texts in Korean , which may introduce some errors due to translation issues .
Introduction
Kazakhstan inherited nuclear-tipped missiles , a nuclear weapon test site , and biological and chemical weapon production facilities when the Soviet Union collapsed .
In its first decade of independence , Kazakhstan dismantled and destroyed Soviet weapons systems and facilities left on its territory and signed several international nonproliferation treaties .
Nuclear
When the Soviet Union collapsed in December 1991 , Kazakhstan inherited 1,410 nuclear warheads and the Semipalatinsk nuclear weapon test site .
Kazakhstan transferred all of these nuclear warheads to Russia by April 1995 and destroyed the nuclear testing infrastructure at Semipalatinsk by July 2000 .
Weapons-grade nuclear material remains in Kazakhstan , however , including three metric tons of plutonium at a shutdown breeder reactor in western Kazakhstan and small amounts of highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) at two nuclear research institutes .
Approximately 600 kilograms of weapons-grade HEU was removed to the United States from the Ulba Metallurgy Plant in 1994 under a joint U.S. - Kazakhstani operation known as Project Sapphire .
Kazakhstan is a party to START-I , the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) .
Biological
Kazakhstan has not declared an official policy against biological weapons ( BW ) .
It has not signed the Biological Toxin and Weapons Convention ( BWC ) nor is it a member of the Australia Group .
Kazakhstani President Nazarbayev , however , has declared Kazakhstan 's commitment to the nonproliferation of BW and associated technologies .
In 1993 , Kazakhstan created a civilian body , the National Center for Biotechnology , to oversee the administration of most of the former BW facilities in Kazakhstan .
These facilities include the following : Biomedpreparat , a large-scale anthrax production facility located in Stepnogorsk ; the Scientific Research Agricultural Institute ( SRAI ) at Otar , which specializes in anti-crop and anti-livestock diseases ; and Biokombinat , a small mobilization production facility located in Almaty , now producing vaccines .
The Scientific Center for Quarantine and Zoonotic Infections ( SCQZI ) ( formerly known as the Anti-Plague Institute ) was also involved in the Soviet BW system and is now under the jurisdiction of the Kazakhstani Ministry of Health .
Both SCQZI and SRAI house extensive collections of virulent strains .
Under Cooperative Threat Reduction ( CTR ) programs , Biomedpreparat has been dismantled and safety and security have been upgraded at SCQZI and SRAI .
Chemical
Kazakhstan inherited one known chemical weapons ( CW ) production plant in the city of Pavlodar .
This plant probably was designed to replace aging plants in Volgograd and Novocheboksarsk ( Russia ) for the production of the binary agent `` novichok .''
The plant 's construction was halted in 1987 , after the Soviet Union became involved in Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) -related negotiations , so it never produced any CW agents .
Kazakhstan joined the CWC in March 2000 .
However , Kazakhstan produced a nil declaration , leaving out the Pavlodar facility .
Missile
Kazakhstan inherited 104 SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) from the Soviet missile complex .
All ICBMs were transferred to Russia for dismantlement by September 1996 and missile silos and silo structures were destroyed under the U.S. Department of Defense Cooperative Threat Reduction ( CTR ) program by September 1999 .
Gidromash , an Almaty -based Soviet-era producer of submarine-launched missiles , was converted to a civilian commercial enterprise under CTR 's Industrial Partnerships Program .

D- If you are a specialist in any field , then you have to master your specialization .
If you could serve the objectives of AL-QAEDA through your specialization , than inform your leadership of that .
E- The brethren are advised to avoid disagreement and argument in religion , discussing religion without proper knowledge is prohibited , and questions of differences are referred to powerful knowledgeable leaders. ( Suraat Alnissa ' )
Six : The pledge
Its legitimacy and its purpose:
The legitimacy of the pledge:
Pledges among Muslims concerning obedience and permissibility is legitimate and conceivable so that every party trusts the other. ( Suraat Yuseef )
So if a Muslim vows to do something , he must fulfill it. ( Suraat Annahl )
The purpose of the pledge:
Matters subject to pledge are either legitimate or permissible duties , legitimate duties like Jihad and obedience to leaders is first in importance .
A legitimate duty for a Muslim and a pledge conforms what is a duty by law , and it is a duty even if it is not subject to a pledge .
According to what has been previously mentioned , than AL-QAEDA secures the pledge of its followers , which includes commitment to its policies and objectives preceded by the commander 's ( Amir ) pledge .

California wildfires continue to spread
Wildfires in California continued to spread on Tuesday , having burned more than 140,000 acres of land throughout the state and caused an estimated US$13 million worth of damage .
The blaze started burning last Wednesday north of Los Angeles .
Emergency crews said they were hopeful that they would be able to control the fire .
3,600 personnel are involved in containing the wildfire .
Currently , twenty-two percent of the blaze is contained , rising from only five percent as little as a day ago .
Changing weather conditions also helped firefighting efforts , as temperature in the area fell to 90 degrees Fahrenheit , down from over a hundred degrees on Monday .
'' I 'm feeling a lot more optimistic today than I did yesterday .
The crews are doing fabulous work out there on the ground , but the bottom line is that they 're fighting for every foot , '' Dietrich said on Tuesday .
In a statement , Californian governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said that `` [ his administration ] is working around the clock to ensure that our brave men and women working on the fires front lines have the resources needed to respond and beat back these fires as quickly as possible . ''

I am confident in the state 's response as these fires continue to burn throughout California , '' he said .
Two firefighters were killed in the blaze on Sunday , after fires burnt their vehicle on front lines .
Over 10,000 residents have evacuated areas threatened by the flames .
Overview
Being one of the few countries in the world that has experienced chemical warfare ( CW ) on the battlefield , Iran ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1997 .
Iranian troops suffered tens of thousands of casualties from Iraqi chemical weapons during the 1980 - 88 Iran - Iraq War .
As a result Iran has promulgated a very public stance against the use of chemical weapons , making numerous vitriolic comments against Iraq 's use of such weapons in international forums .
However , despite such rhetoric , several Western officials accuse Iran of developing similar offensive CW capabilities .
US officials report that Iran can produce several hundred tons of chemical agent annually and that it may have already produced as much as 2,000 tons of agent , including mustard , cyanide , and possibly sarin nerve agent , at plants near Qazvin , Parchin , and Esfahan .
Officials also claim that Iran has produced bombs and artillery rounds filled with these agents , and that it can probably deploy chemical warheads on its long - range missiles .
Iran is suspected of having developed such a capability with aid from individuals and companies in the West , as well as India and China .
Iran 's extensive CW program is allegedly masked using its sophisticated pharmaceutical and agro - industrial companies as plausible cover .
It is further claimed that these companies serve as a front for importing important chemical precursors and related equipment , which are then diverted to the Iranian CW program .
Although information on WMD programs for many countries is often limited , when it comes to assessing Iran 's alleged CW program , one must sift through a mountain of information , much of which is long on allegation and short on specific , corroborated evidence .
This difficulty is compounded by the fact that much of the information can be directly traced back to just a handful of sources , none of which can be independently verified .
Most of the sources have a pre - existing bias against Iran , rendering a bulk of their information subject to speculation .
The following profile attempts to piece together an objective overview of allegations surrounding Iran and its CW capabilities by mining through reports in open source literature from a variety of sources .
History
Iran 's entanglement with CW stems from the legacy of the Iran - Iraq War .
From approximately 1983 - 1988 during the war with Iraq , Iran suffered extensive CW attacks , including blister ( mustard ) and nerve agents .
By the end of the War , Iran appeared to have suffered as many as 50,000 chemical warfare casualties , of whom perhaps 5,000 died .
The weak international response , particularly by the United Nations , to Iraqi use of chemical weapons against Iranian forces left Iran bitter about what it perceived to be a double standard in enforcing international agreements .
Many Iranian officials concluded that their country had to develop the ability to retaliate in kind in order to deter chemical weapons use against it .
In a public interview , the Iranian representative to the United Nations , Rajai'e Korassani , stated that `` ... if the Iraqi regime does not take any steps in putting an end to the crimes of the Iraqi regime , we will retaliate in kind , and in that case , we will certainly announce it . ''
However , several Iranian officials has never hidden his abhorrence of CW use in battlefield .
There are some reports that between 1984 and 1988 Iran employed chemical agents on a limited scale during the war with Iraq ; however , an intensive review of the open literature ( including UN reports from that era ) have failed to verify such claims .
This is despite near - constant Iranian rhetoric during the 1980s , invoking the threat of CW in retaliation if the world community failed to take any action against Iraq .
While several Iranian leaders felt that developing a CW program would counteract the Iraqi threat and prove to be a strong deterrent , others within the clerical Islamic regime publicly condemned any use of chemicals on moral grounds , calling them un - Islamic .
Disagreement over a course of policy action led to several contradictory published reports whether or not Iran decided to pursue a CW program .
Although the status of its offensive capability is somewhat ambiguous , one can definitely conclude that Iran has a defensive program that can be re - engineered into offensive production , if Iranian national security is threatened .
Agents and Delivery
Though there is no concrete evidence that Iran is currently developing CW , there have been several instances where CW precursors were purchased from foreign sources in the past .
Throughout the 1980s , the United States accused Germany of selling dual - use materials and technology to Iran .
In 1989 US authorities found Alcolac International Inc. , a pharmaceutical firm based out of Baltimore , Maryland , guilty of illegally shipping almost 120 tons of thiodyglycol ( a mustard gas precursor ) to Iran .
The same year , US Department of Commerce put export controls on 23 specific chemicals that could aid CW proliferation .
Also in 1989 , the State Trading Corporation of India admitted that it had sold Iran over 60 tons of thionyl chloride ( a nerve agent precursor ) and that its supplier was planning to ship an additional 257 tons of the chemical to Iran .
In 1997 , under a reported multi - million dollar deal , India agreed to construct a `` sophisticated chemical plant at Qazvim , on the outskirts of Tehran . ''
India also agreed to sell Iran phosphorous pentasulfide , a dual - use chemical used in the production of pesticides as well as the nerve agent VX .
The deal eventually fell apart and a similar deal was eventually concluded with China in 1998 .
China reportedly agreed to sell Iran 500 tons of phosphorus pentasulfide .
China has also been involved in several other sales to Iran , involving CW technology ; as a result , several Chinese companies and individuals have faced American sanctions .
One example was the 1997 sale by China to Iran of 40,000 barrels of calcium - hypochlorite , a chemical and biological decontaminating agent .
Other defensive material purchased by Iran includes respirators from Spain , protective gear from South Korea , and atropine autoinjectors from the Netherlands .
In 1995 , Asian- Ways, Ltd. World Co (Hong Kong) Ltd. and Mainway International Ltd. were sanctioned by the US State Department for supplying Iran with `` nerve gas technology . ''
According to US press accounts citing a top secret CIA report dated 2 October 1996 , China sold Iran nearly 400 metric tons of carbon disulfide , a nerve and riot control gas precursor .
In 1997 , two more Chinese companies and were sanctioned by the US State Department for selling Iran CW related precursors and equipment .
The companies involved were Nanjing Chemical Industries Group and Jiangsu Yongli Chemical Engineering and Technology Import / Export Corporation .
They were accused of exporting thionyl chloride , dimethylamine , and ethylene chlorohydrin .
Some of the CW agents Iran has allegedly developed include CS gas ( a riot control agent ) , mustard gas , hydrogen cyanide , and phosgene .
Some sources , citing US intelligence officials , also claim that Iran has developed sarin , tabun , and V - series nerve agents .
There are several delivery routes Iran could take for its chemical agents .
Iran is said to have developed 155 mm artillery shells , mortar rounds , aerial bombs for chemical fill , and possibly chemical warheads for Scuds .
There have also been rumors of using mines to deliver CW agents ( 120 mm ) .
Iran 's well - known Shahab missile is also believed to be capable of carrying chemical warheads , although it is uncertain warheads have been developed or tested .
In 2002 , Iran tested a new version of its Muajar-4 ( Mohajer ) unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAV ) , which some experts claim could be used for potential CBW delivery .
Status
Despite its acquisition of precursors from abroad , Iran is allegedly working to develop an indigenous CW production capability .
The CIA believes that `` Teheran is rapidly approaching self-sufficiency and could become a supplier of CW - related materials to other nations . ''
As of 1996 , the Department of Defense claimed that Iran had stockpiled almost 2000 tons of toxic chemical agents and was continuously working on expanding its CW program .
Iran has several advanced research institutions employing various chemicals for a variety of reasons , including pesticide production , pharmaceutical research , and other medical studies .
Iran has also conducted several military exercises to date that have included defensive chemical and biological weapons maneuvers .
Iran continues to deny any allegations that it is actively pursuing an offensive CW program .
In 1996 , it held the first regional seminar on the national implementation of the CWC in Tehran so that government authorities could familiarize themselves with their duties and obligations under the treaty .
It also held a mock `` trial inspection '' at the Shahid Razkani chemical factory to allow inspectors to see how such a procedure was conducted .
Iran submitted a declaration on its chemical facilities and its past CW stockpile , it has destroyed chemical weapons production equipment in the presence of OPCW inspectors , and it has undergone a number of OPCW inspections of its chemical industrial facilities .
Iran continues to play an active role at the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) , is recognized as a member in good standing , and currently serves on its executive council .
Although US and Israeli intelligence agencies continue to insist Iran maintains a stockpile of chemical weapons , no challenge inspections of Iranian facilities have been requested , and none of the allegations made regarding the stockpiling of CW can be verified in the unclassified domain .
However , Iran continues to retain a strong incentive for developing a defensive CW program .
Major Suppliers / Major Exporters The following summary lists key Iranian imports within the realm of its CW program .
Several chemicals are dual - use in nature and imported under the umbrella of pesticide , petrochemical , and various pharmaceutical ventures .
These sales do not necessarily indicate the presence of an offensive CW capability but are worth noting due to their potential diversion to an illicit Iranian CW program .
Britain
Early 1990s , According to the British Observer , the British government exported chemicals to Iran that can be used to manufacture weapons .
China
Chinese companies have been key suppliers for Iran 's chemical weapons program .
The Chinese corporation SinoChem reportedly delivered 500 tons of phosphorous pentasulfide in 1996 ( primary precursor of VX , controlled by the Australia Group ; China and Iran are not party to this organization ) .
According to US press reports citing a top secret CIA report , China sold Iran nearly 400 metric tons of chemicals used to produce nerve agents and riot control gas .
China is a key supplier of CW equipment and technologies to Iran according to US Department of Defense .
In an unclassified report to Congress , the DCI said that `` Chinese firms had supplied CW - related production equipment and technology to Iran , '' prior to July 1999 , and that evidence during the second half of 1999 `` suggests Iran continues to seek such assistance from Chinese entities , but it is unclear to what extent these efforts have succeeded . ''
China has been Iran 's main source for chemical weapons precursors , manufacturing equipment , and technical expertise since 1994 .
In June 1997 , the DCI reported that China , during July - December 1996 , provided `` considerable CW - related assistance '' to Iran , including production equipment and technology .
According to an intelligence report , cited by the Washington Times on 30 October 1997 , China completed construction in June 1997 of a dual - use plant in Iran for making glass - lined equipment used in producing chemical weapons .
The Chinese firm was Nanjing Chemical and Industrial Group .
A classified US intelligence report identified a Chinese individual , Q.C. Chen , as `` a major supplier of glass - lined equipment and chemicals to Iran 's chemical weapons program . ''
Chen is linked to Nocinco ( the North Chemical Industries Corp. ) , a company that was identified by the CIA as `` having delivered several hundred tons of carbon disulfide , an ingredient in nerve agents . ''
Nocinco is affiliated with the China North Industries Corp. , Norinco .
In 1995 , orders paid for by Razak Laboratories in Teheran and Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries in Tabriz , and brokered by Iran 's International Movalled Industries Corporation ( Imaco ) with the North Chemical Industries Corp. ( Nocinco ) , were not delivered .
They consisted of 49 metric tons of alkyl dimethylamine , used in making detergent , and 17 metric tons of sodium sulfide , a chemical that could be used in making mustard gas .
In January - February 1997 , China supplied Iran with 40,000 barrels of calcium hypochlorite , a chemical - biological - radiological decontamination agent .
In 1997 , Rex International Development Company Ltd. , a company affiliated with the Chinese company Norinco , supplied Iran with high - grade seamless steel pipes , suitable for handling corrosive materials , and associated with chemical weapons production .
In 1997 , two Chinese companies , Nanjing Industries Group and Technology Import / Export Corporation , supplied Iran with thionyl chloride , dimethylamine ( tabun nerve gas precursor ) , ethyl chlorohydrin ( possible mustard precursor ) , and glass - lined mixing vessels .
On 8 March 1996 , the Washington Post reported , `` US intelligence officials have concluded that companies in China are providing Iran with several virtually complete factories suited for making deadly poison gases , '' and that Iranian `` military - related organizations '' are buying from China glass - lined vessels for mixing precursors , special air - filtration equipment , and the technology to manufacture these items and others indigenously .
In May 1998 , the London Daily Telegraph reported that `` Iran has concluded a secret deal with China to purchase banned chemicals that will enable it to become self-sufficient in producing large stockpiles of advanced nerve gas . ''
Under the deal , concluded last month , China supplied Iran with 500 tons of phosphorus pentsulfide , material banned under the terms of the CWC if known to be used in a CW program .
The delivery was made in 10 consignments of 50 tons each , for an estimated $924,000 .
The deal was negotiated by Iran 's Defense Industry Organization and China 's SinoChem Agency .
Previously in 1997 , a statement submitted by the office of Madeline Albright -- then US Secretary of State -- concluded that SinoChem had not been involved in any dual - use shipments to Iran .
East Germany
In 1984 , East Germany ( GDR ) supplied Iran with 5,000 `` respirators , '' which turned out to be industrial half - masks with goggles , which are unsuitable for chemical defense .
The Netherlands
Iran purchased atropine autoinjectors for antidotes to nerve gas from a Dutch company .
India
Report by German intelligence on Iranian efforts to acquire production equipment for tabun and sarin , using three Indian companies as fronts .
`` With the aid of Indian companies , Iran is nearing the completion of a secret poison - gas plant , which was claimed by the Indian companies to be a pesticide factory . ''
The Indian companies named in the classified report include Tata Consulting Engineering , Transpek , and Rallis India .
The Iranian companies involved in the building of the poison - gas complex are Defense Industries , Shahid , Bagheri Industrial Group , and Shahid Hemat Industrial group .
On 23 June 1996 , the Sunday Telegraph reported about a `` secret multi - million - pound deal with the Indian government which will supply banned materials used to manufacture poison gas . ''
Under the deal , India will build a sophisticate chemical plant at Qazvin , which will be used produce phosphorous pentasulfide , a dual - use chemical that could be used to produce chemical weapons .
According to the Sunday Telegraph , Melli Agrochemicals negotiated the deal on behalf of the Iranian regime .
But security experts believe that the deal was authorized by Dr . Majid Tehrani Abbaspur , Iran 's chief security adviser and a close associate of President Rafsanjani .
The deal eventually fell through and Iran sought China as a replacement for India .
In early 1989 , Iran purchased 60 tons of thionyl chloride , a nerve agent precursor , from India .
Israel
Israel has maintained military - industrial ties with Iran , according to an internal report , prepared for the Israeli defense ministry establishment in January 1998 .
The report mentions the sale of 58,000 gas masks by Shalon Chemical Industries after the Iran - Iraq War as well as the supply of gas detectors by Elbit for the identification of chemical warfare agents .
Libya
Iran allegedly supplied Libya with chemical agents in 1987 in exchange for naval mines .
Libya used these agents against Chadian troops later that year .
This allegation was brought forth mostly by US government sources and can not be verified .
Poland
In the mid - 1980s , Mana International Investments , a company registered in Poland and controlled by Nachum Manbar , an Israeli businessman , supplied Iran with NBC protective suits .
Russia
According to an unclassified report to Congress by the DCI from early 2000 , `` Russian entities remain a significant source of biotechnology and chemicals for Iran . ''
South Korea
In 1984 , South Korea supplied Iran with copies of the Finnish Kemira respirators , which proved to be deficient .
Spain
In 1988 , Spain supplied Iran with 200,000 respirators .
Syria
In 1985 , Syria reportedly agreed to supply Iran with chemical weapons , but apparently later backed away from the offer .
In 1994 , reports surfaced that Syria is cooperating with Iran in the development of ballistic missiles designed to carry chemical warheads .
Ukraine
On 18 December 1997 , the Islamic Republic News Agency ( IRNA ) reported that the Eastern railroad network , run by the Bonyad-e Mostazafan va Janbazan , has purchased 100 tank cars from Ukraine , specifically designed to transport highly toxic chemicals .
Several countries
According to Michael Eisenstadt , Iran initially obtained chemical agent precursors from the United States , Germany , and Japan .
When stricter export controls were imposed by these countries in the mid to late 1980s , Iran had to find alternative sources , such as India .
In recent years , China has been the principal source of CW precursors , as well as production technology .
Iran is currently working on becoming self sufficient in the production of these materials .
Capabilities
Iran has a sophisticated base for the development of a chemical weapons program dating back to the Iran - Iraq War ( 1980 - 1988 ) -- a conflict that gave Iran strong incentives for developing a robust chemical defense capability .
There are several unclassified allegations and reports that suggest Iran has developed an offensive CW program as well .
Most of these claims can not be verified in open sources .
However , reports of transactions of various dual - use material is publicly known .
Imports such as thiodyglycol and thionyl chloride can be applied towards legitimate purposes such as dyes , textiles , and pesticides or can be diverted towards an illicit CW program .
Iran also imported several tons of phosphorus pentasulfide , which is on the Australia Group 's watch list for controlled chemical precursors , but not on the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) Schedule lists .
The compound has several legitimate uses in the agricultural industry , specifically relating to pesticides , but is also a starting point for nerve agents such as VX .
Based on such information , some idea of Iran 's CW status can be ascertained .
What to Do Shopping
Inflation has taken its toll in Hong Kong .
While it 's no longer the bargain shopping destination it once was , there are still some good buys to be had .
Since Hong Kong is a duty - free port and charges no sales tax , goods are cheaper here than in the country where they were made .
On photographic equipment , electronic goods , and watches , you avoid the luxury tax payable in your home country .
Specialty goods and souvenirs , often handmade , come from Hong Kong and elsewhere in China .
Custom - made garments by skillful Hong Kong tailors are still much in demand and cost less than elsewhere for comparable garments .
Note that alcohol and tobacco are both exceptions to Hong Kong 's duty - free regime and are subject to tax .
You 'll find that prices are about the same in Hong Kong Central and Kowloon , and somewhat cheaper in Causeway Bay , which caters to local shopping .
Large shops on the fashionable thoroughfares tend to be more expensive than smaller `` family '' shops tucked away in the side streets .
Stores do not open until 10 am or later , but shopping goes on into the evening , up to 9:30 pm .
Most shops are open seven days a week .
Shops in Central are an exception ; they generally close at 6 pm and are not open on Sunday .
The only holiday on which all commerce comes to a halt is the Chinese New Year in January or February .
Buyer Beware .
Be aware that name brands , including electronics , are sometimes fakes , glass may be sold as jade , and that antique you bought may have been made last night .
Always ask for a receipt that records information about the item , and if you buy an antique , be sure to get a certificate of authentication .
Needless to say , avoid peddlers who approach you on the street and offer to take you to wondrous bargains .
The large department stores have fixed prices , but elsewhere you should ask whether there is a discount , especially if you buy several items in one shop .
Compare prices before you buy any significant item .
Always ask to see the manufacturer 's guarantee when purchasing watches , cameras , and audio-visual and electronic equipment .
Note that when haggling , the merchant assumes you are prepared to pay cash .
If , after concluding a deal , you try to pay with a credit card , he may then boost the price in order to cover the card charges .
It is advisable to shop at outlets that are members of the Hong Kong Tourist Association ( HKTA ) , identified by a red junk logo .
Membership imposes an obligation to maintain standards of both quality and service , and provides dissatisfied customers with an officially recognized channel for redressing complaints ; the number to call is Tel 2508 1234 .
Pick up a copy of HKTA 's `` The Official Dining , Entertainment and Shopping Directory `` in which all member stores are listed .
Shipping .
Many stores will pack and ship purchases .
Ask if automatic free insurance is provided .
If the goods are very valuable or fragile , it is a good idea to buy an all - risk insurance for the shipment .
Packages sent to the US or to Europe generally take six to eight weeks by surface mail , and one week by airmail .
Shopping Areas .
Major shopping areas are Tsim Sha Tsui in Kowloon , especially along Nathan Road ; Central on Hong Kong Island , particularly for upscale designer goods ; Causeway Bay for slightly better prices ; and the Hollywood Road area .
Department Stores .

Hong Kong is no longer a factory outlet center since much of its clothing manufacturing has moved elsewhere .
There are factory showrooms in the Pedder Building , 12 Pedder Street , in Central .
Markets .
Markets are the places to use your bargaining skills .
Hong Kong 's most famous and colorful market is the Temple Street Night Market near the Jordan MTR stop .
Every conceivable kind of goods is sold here : clothing , all kinds of electronics , CDs , souvenirs , crafts , and jewelry .
Stanley Market is located on Hong Kong 's southern coast , and is well-known for all kinds of clothing , including silk and cashmere .
Bargain , and carefully examine any merchandise you buy here .
The Jade Market , on Kansu Street in Yau Ma Tei , is known for both jade and freshwater pearls .
This is not the place to make expensive purchases , but it 's great for inexpensive pendants , earrings , and gifts .
What to Buy
Antiques .
Hollywood Road in the Mid-Levels above Central is the most famous antiques street in Hong Kong .
Look for fine Chinese bronzes , embroidery , lacquerware and porcelain , tomb figures , and wood carvings , among other possibilities .
The experts point out that it is not age alone that determines a Chinese antique’s value?—?the dynasties of the past had their creative ups and downs .
For serious antiques , try Honeychurch Antiques at no. 29 for furniture and silver , Tai Sing Company at 122 for porcelain .
For fun you can visit the Low Price Shop at no. 47 or the Cat Street crafts stores and flea market .
Brocades and Silks .

Queen 's Road East in Wan Chai is a furniture manufacturing and retail area .
Jade .
`` Good for the health '' is just one of the many magical qualities that are attributed to these beautiful emerald-green or turquoise stones .
Real jade is extremely expensive , and you may be offered counterfeit jade , which looks exactly like the genuine article .
Some people say you can test the authenticity by touch?—?real jade feels smooth and cool .
Alternatively , you can shine a lamp on the stone?—?real jade shows no reflected light .
Better still , go shopping with an expert .
Jewelry .
Thanks to the duty - free situation , prices in Hong Kong are lower than they are in some other places .
You can buy gemstones loose or set , or have them made up to your own design .
Popular purchases include diamonds and freshwater pearls .
If you do plan to buy jewelry , be sure to consult the `` Shopping Guide to Jewellery '' published by the Hong Kong Tourist Authority to find a reputable dealer .
Kitchen Equipment .
Woks and any other gadgets essential for Chinese cookery make good purchases .
Department stores sell all sorts of intriguing kitchen equipment .
Leather Goods .
Leather is not a great bargain in Hong Kong .
Locally made items do not live up to their European models .
However , the leather garment industry is growing , and there is a wide range of locally produced leather accessories , all at extremely attractive prices .
For European imports , you will pay top dollar .
Musical , Audio , and Video Equipment .
Hong Kong has a vast range of the most high-tech audio-visual , sound , and screen equipment .
Before purchasing , visitors should make sure of compatibility with systems in their own countries .
Be sure to look around and compare before buying .
Whatever you buy , you may be able to work out a discount .
Ready - to - wear Clothes .
Hong Kong 's shops carry almost every recognizable European and many American labels , from top-end designers to the moderately priced or trendy .
Nathan Road , Central , and the hotel malls are places to look .
There are still a great many factory outlet stores with reasonable prices .
You’ll also find bargain clothes for sale at the markets and on push-carts .
Tailoring .
Tailor - made clothes are not as popular in Hong Kong as they were in the past , but hundreds of shops still remain .
Local tailors are experts when it comes to producing custom - tailored garments for both men and women , and are also adept at copying patterns .
The result can be a quality suit at a fair price?—?but made - to - measure clothing is not cheap .
In choosing a tailor , look for HKTA membership .
Many tailors have Web sites or are listed on Web sites .
Tea .
Shops all over town will sell you gift tins of exotic blends .
If you want to learn something about tea , go to the Tea Shop at 149 Hollywood Road , or the Moon Garden Tea House at 5 Hoi Ping Road , Causeway Bay .
The owners will brew up a pot so you can taste before making a choice .
Watches .
The saying `` Time is money '' is quite literally true in Hong Kong : more is spent on watches and clocks here than on cameras and optical goods .
An enormous variety of makes and models are on sale .
Be sure to get the manufacturer’s guarantee stamped or signed if you buy a watch .
Entertainment
Day and night , the action goes on in this vibrant city .
To help you choose a nightlife scene , pick up a copy of Hong Kong Tourist Authority’s dining and entertainment guide for listings , or just simply wander through the maze of neon signs and take your pick .

welcome back to `` people in the news . ''
The Intifada , the spontaneous 1987 Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation , heralded the rise of the Muslim fundamentalism .
In what had been a mostly secular Palestinian movement .
The most popular of these groups Hamas , an acronym for Islamic resistance movement .
In English it means zeal , its aim -- the destruction of Israel .
Hamas is an Islamic movement .
At the very beginning , it was encouraged by Israel because they thought it was a counter weight to Palestinian nationalism which is , of course , a secular movement .
Hamas was founded in 1988 by a blind paraplegic cleric who was influenced by the Islamic muslim brotherhood , with backing from Israel , he set up sharities in the improverished strip in the 1970s .
Slowly it became more and more politicized , and more and more extreme in its demands for an Islamic state .
The extremism took the form of suicide bombings and terrorist attacks .
But Hamas had already become an important part of Palestinian society through its charity work and its influence increased over time by providing community services when the Palestinian authority did not .
Hamas plays on the Palestinian authority 's failure to produce .
Its basic message , the Palestinian authority is corrupt , it fails to deliver , Hamas is not corrupt .
Hamas cares about the person on the street and it does deliver .
Unfortunately , those same charitable organizations , those same charity committees that funnel the funds to needier Palestinians , also serve to support terrorist attacks .
Israel and the United States say Arafat has not been tough enough on terrorism , and have attempted to force him out of the current peace process .
The prime minister known as Abu Mazen must now contend with the rejection of side by side Palestinian and Israeli states .
A cornerstone of the new peace plan .
He 's trying to get Hamas to co- exist with Israel .
Conservative israelis are skeptical .
He is not working against Hamas , he is working in tandem .
He is negotiating with them .
He is not telling them to disband and regulate their weapons , so I have no faith in the ability of Abu Mazen to put terror aside .
Reporter : Settlers call the just concluded Israeli-American- Palestinian summit a surrender , and were not impressed .
Translator : The armed Intifada must end and we must use and resort to peaceful means in our quest to end the occupation and the suffering of the Palestinians , and the Israelis , and to establish the Palestinian state .
Hamas and other Palestinian militant group rejected Abbas ' call to end their attacks with a deadly raid on an Israeli army outpost in Gaza .
We are all saying that the resistance will continue despite the summit in Aqaba .
Israel retaliated on Hamas , namely Al-rantissi , it missed him and killed civilians .
Translator : Hamas will not drop our weapons , even if all leaders are assassinated .
Reporter : Since the second Intifada began in 2000 , over 700 Israelis have been killed , during the same time there have been more than 2,000 Palestinian deaths according to the Red Crescent , including Hamas leaders targeted for assassination .
If you want an end to terrorism , if you want an end to violence , you have to give people hope and you have to give them a stake in the political process .
I think that Hamas is ready to join the political process , however , if the only price for the political price is you must fight Hamas , if that 's what they are requiring Abu Mazen to do , they are almost mandating that he will fail .
The main test of Mahmoud Abbas , will be to establish an overall command of all armed groups , if not , it does n't have a chance .
You know , leaders have to do things
Introduction to BW Terrorism
The release of nerve gas on the Tokyo subway by a Japanese cult on March 20, 1995 , the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 , and the sending of anthrax - tainted letters have made policymakers and the general public concerned that terrorists could use chemical or biological weapons ( CBW ) to inflict mass casualties .
Nevertheless , numerous misconceptions persist about the nature of CBW terrorism -- in particular , how easy it would be for terrorists to produce and employ such weapons .
This tutorial addresses several aspects of biological warfare ( BW ) terrorism , with the goal of providing a greater understanding of the threat and the available policy responses .
How vulnerable is the United States to BW terrorism , and what types of attacks should it be most concerned about ?
Further , what can be done to prevent or reduce the likelihood of incidents of BW terrorism ?
The tutorial is organized into six chapters .
This introductory chapter defines CBW terrorism , explores what types of terrorist groups would be most likely to carry out such attacks , and summarizes U.S. government actions to combat CBW terrorism before and after September 11 .
The next five chapters focus on the technical aspects of biological terrorism , including the biological agents of greatest concern ; the technical hurdles associated with their acquisition , production , and delivery ; historical cases of bioterrorism ; and approaches to the prevention and mitigation of bioterrorist incidents .
Defining Terrorism
Before assessing the threat of CBW terrorism , we need to define the word `` terrorism . ''
For political reasons , no single definition has been accepted worldwide and several different ones are in current use .
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) defines terrorism as : `` The unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government , the civilian population , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives . ''
The U.S. State Department defines terrorism differently , as : `` Premeditated , politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by sub - national groups or clandestine agents , usually intended to influence an audience . ''
Terrorism experts outside government have also developed their own definitions .
For example , Walter Laqueur , a terrorism specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. , defines terrorism as : `` The sub - state application of violence or threatened violence intended to sow panic in a society , to weaken or even overthrow the incumbents , and to bring about political change . ''
Some definitions of terrorism go beyond sub - state actors to include repressive governments that may carry out acts of `` state terrorism '' against their own citizens .
The lack of a universally accepted definition of terrorism has allowed political leaders to manipulate the term for propaganda purposes .
During the Cold War , for example , the United States and the Soviet Union each supported sub - national groups engaged in proxy wars .
The United States called the groups it supported `` freedom fighters '' ( such as the contras in Nicaragua and the mujahideen in Afghanistan ) , while labeling the groups supported by the Soviet Union as `` terrorists '' ( such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization ) .
The Soviets , of course , described the same groups in exactly opposite terms .
For the purposes of this tutorial , however , the term `` terrorism '' will be used to describe acts that incorporate the following elements : Intentional or threatened violence directed against civilians or noncombatants ; Actors that are sub - national groups or individuals ( although they may receive financial or logistical support from governments ) ; Motivations that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; Often , some element of symbolism in the choice of target , together with the desire to elicit fear in a larger audience beyond the immediate victims of an attack .
Differences between Chemical and Biological Weapons
In discussing CBW terrorism , it is important to distinguish between terrorist attacks involving chemical and biological warfare agents , which differ in several ways:
Chemical warfare ( CW ) agents are non-living , manufactured chemicals that are highly toxic and can enter the body through the lungs or the skin .
They cause illness or death within minutes to hours after exposure .
Biological warfare ( BW ) agents are microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria that infect humans , livestock , or crops and cause an incapacitating or fatal disease .
Symptoms of illness do not appear immediately but only after a delay , or `` incubation period , '' that may last for days to weeks .
Toxins -- nonliving poisons produced by living plants , insects , and animals -- are in a gray area between CW and BW agents .
They generally have an incubation period of hours to days , longer than that of CW agents but shorter than that of BW agents .
Chapters 2 - 6 discuss the technical issues of biological terrorism in greater detail .
Why Would Terrorists Want to Employ CBW ?
There are several reasons why certain terrorist groups or individuals might favor the use of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
If used effectively , CBW are potentially capable of inflicting a large number of casualties -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .
CBW can have a greater psychological impact than conventional explosives , as suggested by the 2001 anthrax letter attacks , which killed only five people but frightened millions of Americans .
Terrorists may seek to obtain greater status or bargaining power by demonstrating that they have the technological capabilities required to develop , produce , and deliver CBW agents .
Although CBW agents are not nearly as destructive as nuclear weapons , they are much easier and cheaper to acquire .
The psychology or ideology of a particular terrorist group or individual may lead to a fascination with poisons and disease .
Characteristics of CBW Terrorists
Those groups and individuals most likely to engage in terrorism with chemical or biological weapons lie at the intersection of three attributes : ( 1 ) motivation , ( 2 ) organizational structure , and ( 3 ) technical capability .
Motivation : The terrorist groups of greatest concern are motivated to inflict indiscriminate mass casualties ( random ; not targeting a specific person or persons ) and to engage in innovative and risky tactics .
Some groups may have a particular fascination with plagues and poisons .
Organizational Structure : The terrorist groups of greatest concern have an organizational structure and internal control mechanisms that enable them to prevent penetration by government agents or defection by group members .
Technical Capability : The terrorist groups of greatest concern possess the technical capability and know-how to acquire , produce , and deliver chemical or biological agents , or to recruit scientific experts in these areas .
Historically , very few terrorist groups have possessed the motivation , the organization , and the technical capability to conduct a successful chemical or biological terrorist attack , particularly on a large scale .
Some groups in the past have tried to acquire a CBW capability , but have lacked the technical expertise to do so .
Other groups have acquired a pathogen or toxin and have been motivated to use it , but were penetrated by law enforcement or exposed by defectors before the attack could be carried out .
Is the number of groups capable of CBW terrorism increasing ?
Even before the events of September 11 and the anthrax letter attacks of fall 2001 , analysts began to observe some troubling developments along all three dimensions of the CBW terrorism threat .
A few terrorist groups active today are more motivated to carry out mass - casualty attacks , better organized to resist outside penetration , and are actively pursuing technologies and know-how relevant to CBW terrorism .
Yet although small terrorist cells may be more motivated to use CBW and harder for counterterrorism authorities to interdict , they may lack the technical and financial resources needed to produce and deliver CBW agents .
Further details about the motivation and organizational structure of the terrorist groups most likely to carry out CBW attacks are provided in the next two pages. ( The specific capabilities required to acquire and deliver biological agents are discussed in subsequent chapters . )
Motivation
In the past , politically motivated terrorist organizations , such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army ( PIRA ) or the Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) , have not sought to inflict indiscriminate mass casualties .
Such groups engage in violent attacks against civilian targets with the aim of influencing public opinion and applying pressure on government officials .
Nevertheless , it would be counterproductive for politically motivated terrorists to inflict too many casualties , for two reasons:
These groups have an outside constituency that would be alienated by indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks , potentially triggering a political backlash .
Mass - casualty attacks would provoke government authorities to pursue the terrorists so aggressively that they would ultimately be destroyed as a viable organization .
Over the past few decades , however , a `` new breed '' of terrorists has come on the scene .
In general , these groups are more prepared to inflict indiscriminate casualties because they are not driven by specific political goals but rather by irrational belief systems , extremist ideologies ( such as neo - Nazism ) , apocalyptic prophecy ( predicting the end of the world ) , or religious fundamentalism .
Religious Terrorism
Whereas most terrorist groups during the 1960s and 1970s were motivated either by left-wing ideology ( socialist / communist policies advocated by Marxist - Leninist or Maoist groups ) or by national - separatist goals ( a group 's pursuit to become an independent state based on its ethnic , racial , or cultural make-up ) , the number of groups characterized primarily by religious beliefs began to increase in the 1980s .
According to terrorism analyst Bruce Hoffman , in 1968 , none of the 11 major terrorist organizations then active was religiously motivated .
By 1995 , however , 26 out of 56 known , active international terrorist groups could be classified as religious in character and / or motivation .
Such groups either promote extreme forms of the world 's major religions or entirely `` new '' belief systems , usually in the form of cults .
Examples include the Aum Shinrikyo cult in Japan and The Covenant , the Sword , and the Arm of the Lord ( CSA ) in the United States .
Religiously motivated terrorist groups are more likely than political terrorists to resort to non - conventional weapons for the following reasons:
They may desire not just to make a symbolic point but to physically and completely destroy their enemies .
They may view extreme violence as divinely sanctioned and the fulfillment of God 's commandments .
They are largely unaffected by public opinion because they act on behalf of their deity and their co - religionists .
They may believe in apocalyptic prophecy and actively seek to bring about Armageddon , or the end of the world .
Single - Issue Terrorism
Another new type of terrorist organization focuses on a single , hotly disputed issue such as abortion , animal rights , environmental protection , or genetic engineering .
Members of these groups feel passionately about their chosen issue and are prepared to strike out violently against those who disagree with them .
The Army of God , for example , is an extremist anti - abortion group that has assassinated doctors who perform abortions and has sent hundreds of anthrax hoax letters to family - planning clinics around the United States .
Right Wing Terrorism
The 1990s saw the rise of right - wing terrorism , including neo - Nazis and neo - Fascists in Europe and white supremacists and anti - government ( `` Patriot '' ) organizations in the United States .
The Patriot movement subscribes to a conspiratorial world-view in which the federal government is in league with Jewish bankers to deprive ordinary Americans of their land and liberty .
Patriot groups in rural areas often form armed militias that stockpile weapons and conduct training exercises in preparation for an anticipated violent showdown with the federal government or United Nations forces .
These confrontations are not purely in the realm of fantasy , however .
Several highly publicized clashes between federal authorities and local armed groups have occurred over the past decade , including the confrontation between Randy Weaver and federal marshals at Ruby Ridge , Idaho , on August 21 - 22, 1992 , during which Weaver 's son and wife were killed ; and the disastrous siege by federal agents of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco , Texas , in April 1993 .
In the United States , right - wing extremism is often linked to the Christian Identity church , a twisted form of Christianity that is bitterly racist and anti - Semitic .
Members of the church believe that whites are the real children of Israel , Jews are the evil offspring of Satan or Cain , and blacks and other racial minorities are sub - human .
Some Christian Identity groups believe in apocalyptic prophecy , including the `` purifying '' role of biblical plagues to vanquish sinners and help bring about Armageddon and the Second Coming .
Some subscribers to Patriot and Christian Identity ideology are not formal members of right - wing groups .
Instead , they constitute what terrorism analyst Jerrold Post has called a `` community of belief , '' linked through email and Internet websites rather than direct interpersonal contact .
Timothy McVeigh , who perpetrated the April 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City , was not a member of a Patriot organization but identified strongly with the anti - government community of belief .
The Al Qa'ida Network
Al Qa'ida ( Arabic for `` The Base `` ) is a loosely connected global network of Islamic terrorist groups that seek to expel U.S. troops from the Middle East , inflict revenge for what they perceive as America 's attacks on Muslims and its one - sided support of Israel , and eliminate Western cultural influences they consider contrary to Islam .
Many Al Qa'ida terrorists are prepared to sacrifice their own lives to carry out attacks , making them essentially impossible to deter .
On September 11, 2001 , nineteen Al Qa'ida terrorists hijacked four commercial aircraft and flew three of them into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon ; the fourth crashed into a field in Shanksville , Pennsylvania .
This single incident caused more than 3,000 deaths .
Shaped by a fanatical worldview , the terrorists sought to kill as many Americans as possible while striking at symbolic targets of U.S. economic and military power .
The September 11 attacks were also characterized by innovative tactics , impressive execution , and a sharp escalation in the level of violence .
A few pieces of evidence suggest that Al Qa'ida is interested in acquiring chemical and biological weapons .
The network 's mastermind , Osama bin Laden , has stated openly that it is his `` religious duty '' to acquire weapons of mass destruction .
In March 2002 , U.S. troops in Afghanistan found an abandoned laboratory under construction near Kandahar where Al Qa'ida members apparently planned to develop biological agents .
In August 2002 , the Cable News Network ( CNN ) broadcast an Al Qa'ida training video showing experiments on dogs with cyanide gas .
On March 1, 2003 , documents and computer hard drives were seized during the capture of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , a key operational planner for Al Qa'ida .
These materials revealed that the organization had recruited a Pakistani microbiologist , acquired materials to manufacture botulinum toxin , and developed a workable plan for anthrax production .
No evidence obtained to date suggests that Al Qa'ida has actually succeeded in producing significant quantities of chemical or biological agents or developed an effective means of delivery , but the intention to do so is clearly present .
'' THE SYSTEM WAS BLINKING RED"
THE SUMMER OF THREAT
As 2001 began , counterterrorism officials were receiving frequent but fragmentary
reports about threats .
Indeed , there appeared to be possible threats almost
everywhere the United States had interests-including at home .
To understand how the escalation in threat reporting was handled in the summer of
2001 , it is useful to understand how threat information in general is collected and
conveyed .
Information is collected through several methods , including signals
intelligence and interviews of human sources , and gathered into intelligence
reports .
Depending on the source and nature of the reporting , these reports may be
highly classified-and therefore tightly held-or less sensitive and widely
disseminated to state and local law enforcement agencies .
Threat reporting must be
disseminated , either through individual reports or through threat advisories .
Such
advisories , intended to alert their recipients , may address a specific threat or be
a general warning .
Because the amount of reporting is so voluminous , only a select fraction can be
chosen for briefing the president and senior officials .
During 2001 , Director of
Central Intelligence GeorgeTenet was briefed regularly regarding threats and other
operational information relating to Usama Bin Ladin .
He in turn met daily with President Bush , who was briefed by the CIA through what is
known as the President 's Daily Brief ( PDB ) .
Each PDB consists of a series of six to
eight relatively short articles or briefs covering a broad array of topics ; CIA
staff decides which subjects are the most important on any given day .
There were
more than 40 intelligence articles in the PDBs from January 20 to September 10 ,
2001 , that related to Bin Ladin .
The PDB is considered highly sensitive and is
distributed to only a handful of high-level officials .
The Senior Executive Intelligence Brief ( SEIB ) , distributed to a broader group of
officials , has a similar format and generally covers the same subjects as the PDB .
It usually contains less information so as to protect sources and methods .
Like
their predecessors , the Attorney General , the FBI Director , and Richard Clarke , the
National Security Council ( NSC ) counterterrorism coordinator , all received the SEIB ,
not the PDB .
Clarke and his staff had extensive access to terrorism reporting , but they did not
have access to internal , nondisseminated information at the National Security Agency
( NSA ) , CIA , or FBI .
The Drumbeat Begins In the spring of 2001 , the level of
reporting on terrorist threats and planned attacks increased dramatically to its
highest level since the millennium alert .
At the end of March , the intelligence
community disseminated a terrorist threat advisory , indicating a heightened threat
of Sunni extremist terrorist attacks against U.S. facilities , personnel , and other
interests .
On March 23 , in connection with discussions about possibly reopening Pennsylvania
Avenue in front of the White House , Clarke warned National Security Advisor
Condoleezza Rice that domestic or foreign terrorists might use a truck bomb-their
'' weapon of choice '' -on Pennsylvania Avenue .
That would result , he said , in the
destruction of the West Wing and parts of the residence .
5 He also told her that he
thought there were terrorist cells within the United States , including al Qaeda .
The next week , Rice was briefed on the activities of Abu Zubaydah and on CIA efforts
to locate him .
As pointed out in chapter 6 , Abu Zubaydah had been a major figure in
the millennium plots .
Over the next few weeks , the CIA repeatedly issued
warnings-including calls from DCI Tenet to Clarke -that Abu Zubaydah was planning an
operation in the near future .
One report cited a source indicating that Abu Zubaydah
was planning an attack in a country that CIA analysts thought might be Israel , or
perhaps Saudi Arabia or India .
Clarke relayed these reports to Rice .
In response to these threats , the FBI sent a message to all its field offices on
April 13 , summarizing reporting to date .
It asked the offices to task all resources,
including human sources and electronic databases , for any information pertaining to
'' current operational activities relating to Sunni extremism . ''
It did not suggest
that there was a domestic threat .
The interagency Counterterrorism Security Group ( CSG ) that Clarke chaired discussed
the Abu Zubaydah reports on April 19 .
The next day , a briefing to top officials
reported `` Bin Ladin planning multiple operations . ''
When the deputies discussed al
Qaeda policy on April 30 , they began with a briefing on the threat .
In May 2001 , the drumbeat of reporting grew louder with reports to top officials that
'' Bin Ladin public profile may presage attack '' and `` Bin Ladin network 's plans
advancing . ''
In early May , a walk-in to the FBI claimed there was a plan to launch
attacks on London , Boston , and New York .
Attorney General John Ashcroft was briefed
by the CIA on May 15 regarding al Qaeda generally and the current threat reporting
specifically .
The next day brought a report that a phone call to a U.S. embassy had
warned that Bin Ladin supporters were planning an attack in the United States using
'' high explosives . ''
On May 17 , based on the previous day 's report , the first item on
the CSG 's agenda was `` UBL : Operation Planned in U.S. ''
The
anonymous caller 's tip could not be corroborated .
Late May brought reports of a possible hostage plot against Americans abroad to force
the release of prisoners , including Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman , the `` Blind Sheikh , ''
who was serving a life sentence for his role in the 1993 plot to blow up sites in
New York City .
The reporting noted that operatives might opt to hijack an aircraft
or storm a U.S. embassy .
This report led to a Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA )
information circular to airlines noting the potential for `` an airline hijacking to
free terrorists incarcerated in the United States . ''
Other reporting mentioned that
Abu Zubaydah was planning an attack , possibly against Israel , and expected to carry
out several more if things went well .
On May 24 alone , counterterrorism officials
grappled with reports alleging plots in Yemen and Italy , as well as a report about a
cell in Canada that an anonymous caller had claimed might be planning an attack
against the United States .
Reports similar to many of these were made available to President Bush in morning
intelligence briefings with DCI Tenet , usually attended by Vice President Dick
Cheney and National Security Advisor Rice .
While these briefings discussed general
threats to attack America and American interests , the specific threats mentioned in
these briefings were all overseas .
On May 29 , Clarke suggested that Rice ask DCI Tenet what more the United States could
do to stop Abu Zubaydah from launching '' a series of major terrorist attacks , ''
probably on Israeli targets , but possibly on U.S. facilities .
Clarke wrote to Rice
and her deputy , Stephen Hadley , `` When these attacks occur , as they likely will , we
will wonder what more we could have done to stop them . ''
In May , CIA Counterterrorist
Center ( CTC ) Chief Cofer Black told Rice that the current threat level was a 7 on a
scale of 1 to 10 , as compared to an 8 during the millennium .
High Probability of Near-Term `` Spectacular ''
Attacks
Threat reports surged in June and July , reaching an even higher peak of urgency .
The
summer threats seemed to be focused on Saudi Arabia , Israel , Bahrain , Kuwait , Yemen ,
and possibly Rome , but the danger could be anywhere- including a possible attack on
the G-8 summit in Genoa .
A June 12 CIA report passing along biographical background
information on several terrorists mentioned , in commenting on Khalid Sheikh
Mohammed , that he was recruiting people to travel to the United States to meet with
colleagues already there so that they might conduct terrorist attacks on Bin Ladin 's
behalf .
On June 22 , the CIA notified all its station chiefs about intelligence
suggesting a possible al Qaeda suicide attack on a U.S. target over the next few
days .
DCITenet asked that all U.S. ambassadors be briefed .
That same day , the State Department notified all embassies of the terrorist threat
and updated its worldwide public warning .
In June , the State Department initiated
the Visa Express program in Saudi Arabia as a security measure , in order to keep
long lines of foreigners away from vulnerable embassy spaces .
The program permitted
visa applications to be made through travel agencies , instead of directly at the
embassy or consulate .
A terrorist threat advisory distributed in late June indicated a high probability of
near-term `` spectacular '' terrorist attacks resulting in numerous casualties .
Other
reports ' titles warned , '' Bin Ladin Attacks May be Imminent '' and `` Bin Ladin and
Associates Making Near-Term Threats . ''
The latter reported multiple attacks planned
over the coming days , including a `` severe blow '' against U.S. and Israeli `` interests ''
during the next two weeks .
On June 21 , near the height of the threat reporting , U.S. Central Command raised the
force protection condition level for U.S. troops in six countries to the highest
possible level , Delta .
The U.S. Fifth Fleet moved out of its port in Bahrain , and a
U.S. Marine Corps exercise in Jordan was halted . U.S. embassies in the Persian Gulf
conducted an emergency security review , and the embassy in Yemen was closed .
The CSG
had foreign emergency response teams , known as FESTs , ready to move on four hours '
notice and kept up the terrorism alert posture on a `` rolling 24 hour basis . ''
On June 25 , Clarke warned Rice and Hadley that six separate intelligence reports
showed al Qaeda personnel warning of a pending attack .
An Arabic television station
reported Bin Ladin 's pleasure with al Qaeda leaders who were saying that the next
weeks `` will witness important surprises '' and that U.S. and Israeli interests will be
targeted .
Al Qaeda also released a new recruitment and fund-raising tape .
Clarke
wrote that this was all too sophisticated to be merely a psychological operation to
keep the United States on edge , and the CIA agreed .
The intelligence reporting
consistently described the upcoming attacks as occurring on a calamitous level,
indicating that they would cause the world to be in turmoil and that they would
consist of possible multiple-but not necessarily simultaneous-attacks .
On June 28 , Clarke wrote Rice that the pattern of al Qaeda activity indicating attack
planning over the past six weeks `` had reached a crescendo. '' '' A series of new reports
continue to convince me and analysts at State, CIA , DIA [Defense Intelligence
Agency ] , and NSA that a major terrorist attack or series of attacks is likely in
July , '' he noted .
One al Qaeda intelligence report warned that something `` very , very,
very , very '' big was about to happen , and most of Bin Ladin 's network was reportedly
anticipating the attack .
In late June , the CIA ordered all its station chiefs to
share information on al Qaeda with their host governments and to push for immediate
disruptions of cells .
The headline of a June 30 briefing to top officials was stark: '' Bin Ladin Planning
High-Profile Attacks . ''
The report stated that Bin Ladin operatives expected
near-term attacks to have dramatic consequences of catastrophic proportions .
That
same day , Saudi Arabia declared its highest level of terror alert .
Despite evidence
of delays possibly caused by heightened U.S. security , the planning for attacks was
continuing .
On July 2 , the FBI Counterterrorism Division sent a message to federal agencies and
state and local law enforcement agencies summarizing information regarding threats
from Bin Ladin .
It warned that there was an increased volume of threat reporting,
indicating a potential for attacks against U.S. targets abroad from groups `` aligned
with or sympathetic to Usama Bin Ladin . ''
Despite the general warnings , the message
further stated , `` The FBI has no information indicating a credible threat of
terrorist attack in the United States . ''
However , it went on to emphasize that the
possibility of attack in the United States could not be discounted .
It also noted
that the July 4 holiday might heighten the threats .
The report asked recipients
to '' exercise extreme vigilance '' and `` report suspicious activities '' to the FBI .
It did
not suggest specific actions that they should take to prevent attacks .
Disruption operations against al Qaeda -affiliated cells were launched involving 20
countries .
Several terrorist operatives were detained by foreign governments,
possibly disrupting operations in the Gulf and Italy and perhaps averting attacks
against two or three U.S. embassies .
Clarke and others told us of a particular
concern about possible attacks on the Fourth of July .
After it passed uneventfully,
the CSG decided to maintain the alert .
To enlist more international help , Vice President Cheney contacted Saudi Crown Prince
Abdullah on July 5 .
Hadley apparently called European counterparts , while Clarke
worked with senior officials in the Gulf .
In late July , because of threats , Italy
closed the airspace over Genoa and mounted antiaircraft batteries at the Genoa
airport during the G-8 summit , which President Bush attended .
At home , the CSG arranged for the CIA to brief intelligence and security officials
from several domestic agencies .
On July 5 , representatives from the Immigration and
Naturalization Service ( INS ) , the FAA , the Coast Guard , the Secret Service , Customs ,
the CIA , and the FBI met with Clarke to discuss the current threat .
Attendees report
that they were told not to disseminate the threat information they received at the
meeting .
They interpreted this direction to mean that although they could brief
their superiors , they could not send out advisories to the field .
An NSC official
recalls a somewhat different emphasis , saying that attendees were asked to take the
information back to their home agencies and `` do what you can '' with it , subject to
classification and distribution restrictions .
A representative from the INS asked
for a summary of the information that she could share with field offices .
She never
received one .
That same day , the CIA briefed Attorney General Ashcroft on the al Qaeda threat,
warning that a significant terrorist attack was imminent .
Ashcroft was told that
preparations for multiple attacks were in late stages or already complete and that
little additional warning could be expected .
The briefing addressed only threats
outside the United States .
The next day , the CIA representative told the CSG that al Qaeda members believed the
upcoming attack would be `` spectacular , '' qualitatively different from anything they
had done to date .
Apparently as a result of the July 5 meeting with Clarke , the interagency committee
on federal building security was tasked to examine security measures .
This committee
met on July 9 , when 37 officials from 27 agencies and organizations were briefed on
the `` current threat level '' in the United States .
They were told that not only the
threat reports from abroad but also the recent convictions in the East Africa
bombings trial , the conviction of Ahmed Ressam , and the just-returned KhobarTowers
indictments reinforced the need to `` exercise extreme vigilance . ''
Attendees were
expected to determine whether their respective agencies needed enhanced security
measures .
On July 18, 2001 , the State Department provided a warning to the public regarding
possible terrorist attacks in the Arabian Peninsula .
Acting FBI Director Thomas Pickard told us he had one of his periodic conference
calls with all special agents in charge on July 19 .
He said one of the items he
mentioned was the need , in light of increased threat reporting , to have evidence
response teams ready to move at a moment 's notice , in case of an attack .
He did not task field offices to try to determine whether any plots were being
considered within the United States or to take any action to disrupt any such plots .
In mid-July , reporting started to indicate that Bin Ladin 's plans had been delayed,
maybe for as long as two months , but not abandoned .
On July 23 , the lead item for
CSG discussion was still the al Qaeda threat , and it included mention of suspected
terrorist travel to the United States .
On July 31 , an FAA circular appeared alerting the aviation community to `` reports of
possible near-term terrorist operations . . . particularly on the Arabian Peninsula
and/or Israel . ''
It stated that the FAA had no credible evidence of specific plans to
attack U.S. civil aviation , though it noted that some of the `` currently active ''
terrorist groups were known to `` plan and train for hijackings '' and were able to build
and conceal sophisticated explosive devices in luggage and consumer products .
Tenet told us that in his world `` the system was blinking red . ''
By late July , Tenet
said , it could not `` get any worse . ''
Not everyone was
convinced .
Some asked whether all these threats might just be deception .
On June 30 ,
the SEIB contained an article titled `` Bin Ladin Threats Are Real . ''
Yet Hadley told
Tenet in July that Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz questioned the
reporting .
Perhaps Bin Ladin was trying to study U.S. reactions .
Tenet replied that
he had already addressed the Defense Department 's questions on this point ; the
reporting was convincing .
To give a sense of his anxiety at the time , one senior
official in the Counterterrorist Center told us that he and a colleague were
considering resigning in order to go public with their concerns .
The Calm Before the Storm
On July 27 , Clarke informed Rice and Hadley that the spike in intelligence about a
near-term al Qaeda attack had stopped .
He urged keeping readiness high during the
August vacation period , warning that another report suggested an attack had just
been postponed for a few months `` but will still happen . ''
On August 1 , the FBI issued an advisory that in light of the increased volume of
threat reporting and the upcoming anniversary of the East Africa embassy bombings,
increased attention should be paid to security planning .
It noted that although most
of the reporting indicated a potential for attacks on U.S. interests abroad , the
possibility of an attack in the United States could not be discounted .
On August 3 , the intelligence community issued an advisory concluding that the threat
of impending al Qaeda attacks would likely continue indefinitely .
Citing threats in
the Arabian Peninsula , Jordan , Israel , and Europe , the advisory suggested that al
Qaeda was lying in wait and searching for gaps in security before moving forward
with the planned attacks .
During the spring and summer of 2001 , President Bush had on several occasions asked
his briefers whether any of the threats pointed to the United States .
Reflecting on
these questions , the CIA decided to write a briefing article summarizing its
understanding of this danger .
Two CIA analysts involved in preparing this briefing
article believed it represented an opportunity to communicate their view that the
threat of a Bin Ladin attack in the United States remained both current and
serious .
The result was an article in the August 6 Presidential Daily Brief titled `` Bin Ladin
Determined to Strike in US . ''
It was the 36th PDB item briefed so far that year that
related to Bin Ladin or al Qaeda , and the first devoted to the possibility of an
attack in the United States .
The President told us the August 6 report was
historical in nature .
President Bush said the article told him that al Qaeda was
dangerous , which he said he had known since he had become President .
The President
said Bin Ladin had long been talking about his desire to attack America .
He recalled
some operational data on the FBI , and remembered thinking it was heartening that 70
investigations were under way .
As best he could recollect , Rice had mentioned that
the Yemenis ' surveillance of a federal building in New York had been looked into in
May and June , but there was no actionable intelligence .
He did not recall discussing
the August 6 report with the Attorney General or whether Rice had done so .
He said
that if his advisers had told him there was a cell in the United States , they would
have moved to take care of it .
That never happened .
Although the following day 's SEIB repeated the title of this PDB , it did not contain
the reference to hijackings , the alert in New York , the alleged casing of buildings
in New York , the threat phoned in to the embassy , or the fact that the FBI had
approximately 70 ongoing bin Ladin-related investigations .
The following is the text of an item from the Presidential Daily Brief received by
President George W. Bush on August 6 , 2001.37 Redacted material is indicated by
brackets .
Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US Clandestine , foreign government , and media
reports indicate Bin Ladin since 1997 has wanted to conduct terrorist attacks in
the US .
Bin Ladin implied in US television interviews in 1997 and 1998 that his
followers would follow the example of World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef and
'' bring the fighting to America . ''
After US missile strikes on his base in
Afghanistan in 1998 , Bin Ladin told followers he wanted to retaliate in
Washington , according to a [ - ] service .
An Egyptian Islamic Jihad ( EIJ ) operative told an [ - ] service at the same time
that Bin Ladin was planning to exploit the operative 's access to the US to mount
a terrorist strike .
The millennium plotting in Canada in 1999 may have been part of Bin Ladin 's first
serious attempt to implement a terrorist strike in the US .
Convicted plotter
Ahmed Ressam has told the FBI that he conceived the idea to attack Los Angeles
International Airport himself , but that Bin Ladin lieutenant Abu Zubaydah
encouraged him and helped facilitate the operation .
Ressam also said that in
1998 Abu Zubaydah was planning his own US attack .
Ressam says Bin Ladin was aware of the Los Angeles operation .
Although Bin Ladin has not succeeded , his attacks against the US Embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 demonstrate that he prepares operations years in
advance and is not deterred by setbacks .
Bin Ladin associates surveilled our
Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam as early as 1993 , and some members of the
Nairobi cell planning the bombings were arrested and deported in 1997 .
Al-Qa'ida members-including some who are US citizens-have resided in or traveled
to the US for years , and the group apparently maintains a support structure that
could aid attacks .
Two al-Qua ' da members found guilty in the conspiracy to bomb
our embassies in East Africa were US citizens , and a senior EIJ member lived in
California in the mid- 1990s .
A clandestine source said in 1998 that a Bin Ladin
cell in New York was recruiting Muslim-American youth for attacks .
We have not been able to corroborate some of the more sensational threat
reporting , such as that from a [ - ] service in 1998 saying that Bin Ladin wanted
to hijack a US aircraft to gain the release of `` Blind Shaykh ''
'Umar 'Abd
al-Rahman and other US -held extremists .
Nevertheless , FBI information since that time indicates patterns of suspicious
activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other
types of attacks , including recent surveillance of federal buildings in New
York .
The FBI is conducting approximately 70 full field investigations throughout the
US that it considers Bin Ladin -related .
CIA and the FBI are investigating a call
to our Embassy in the UAE in May saying that a group of Bin Ladin supporters was
in the US planning attacks with explosives .
No CSG or other NSC meeting was held to discuss the possible threat of a strike in
the United States as a result of this report .
Late in the month , a foreign service reported that Abu Zubaydah was considering
mounting terrorist attacks in the United States , after postponing possible
operations in Europe .
No targets , timing , or method of attack were provided .
We have found no indication of any further discussion before September 11 among the
President and his top advisers of the possibility of a threat of an al Qaeda attack
in the United States .
DCI Tenet visited President Bush in Crawford , Texas , on August
17 and participated in PDB briefings of the President between August 31 ( after the
President had returned to Washington ) and September 10 .
But Tenet does not recall
any discussions with the President of the domestic threat during this period .
Most of the intelligence community recognized in the summer of 2001 that the number
and severity of threat reports were unprecedented .
Many officials told us that they
knew something terrible was planned , and they were desperate to stop it .
Despite
their large number , the threats received contained few specifics regarding time,
place , method , or target .
Most suggested that attacks were planned against targets
overseas ; others indicated threats against unspecified `` U.S. interests . ''
We can not
say for certain whether these reports , as dramatic as they were , related to the 9/11
attacks .
Government Response to the Threats
National Security Advisor Rice told us that the CSG was the `` nerve center '' for
running the crisis , although other senior officials were involved over the course of
the summer .
In addition to his daily meetings with President Bush , and weekly
meetings to go over other issues with Rice , Tenet was speaking regularly with
Secretary of State Colin Powell and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld .
The
foreign policy principals routinely talked on the telephone every day on a variety
of topics .
Hadley told us that before 9/11 , he and Rice did not feel they had the job of
coordinating domestic agencies .
They felt that Clarke and the CSG ( part of the NSC )
were the NSC 's bridge between foreign and domestic threats .
There was a clear disparity in the levels of response to foreign versus domestic
threats .
Numerous actions were taken overseas to disrupt possible attacks- enlisting
foreign partners to upset terrorist plans , closing embassies , moving military assets
out of the way of possible harm .
Far less was done domestically- in part , surely,
because to the extent that specifics did exist , they pertained to threats overseas .
As noted earlier , a threat against the embassy in Yemen quickly resulted in its
closing .
Possible domestic threats were more vague .
When reports did not specify
where the attacks were to take place , officials presumed that they would again be
overseas , though they did not rule out a target in the United States .
Each of the
FBI threat advisories made this point .
Clarke mentioned to National Security Advisor Rice at least twice that al Qaeda
sleeper cells were likely in the United States .
In January 2001 , Clarke forwarded a
strategy paper to Rice warning that al Qaeda had a presence in the United States .
He
noted that two key al Qaeda members in the Jordanian cell involved in the millennium
plot were naturalized U.S. citizens and that one jihadist suspected in the East
Africa bombings had `` informed the FBI that an extensive network of al Qida 'sleeper
agents ' currently exists in the US . ''
He added that Ressam 's abortive December 1999
attack revealed al Qaeda supporters in the United States .
His analysis , however , was based not on new threat reporting but on past experience .
The September 11 attacks fell into the void between the foreign and domestic threats .
The foreign intelligence agencies were watching overseas , alert to foreign threats
to U.S. interests there .
The domestic agencies were waiting for evidence of a
domestic threat from sleeper cells within the United States .
No one was looking for
a foreign threat to domestic targets .
The threat that was coming was not from
sleeper cells .
It was foreign-but from foreigners who had infiltrated into the
United States .
A second cause of this disparity in response is that domestic agencies did not know
what to do , and no one gave them direction .
Cressey told us that the CSG did not
tell the agencies how to respond to the threats .
He noted that the agencies that
were operating overseas did not need direction on how to respond ; they had
experience with such threats and had a `` playbook . ''
In contrast , the domestic
agencies did not have a game plan .
Neither the NSC ( including the CSG ) nor anyone
else instructed them to create one .
This lack of direction was evident in the July 5 meeting with representatives from
the domestic agencies .
The briefing focused on overseas threats .
The domestic
agencies were not questioned about how they planned to address the threat and were
not told what was expected of them .
Indeed , as noted earlier , they were specifically
told they could not issue advisories based on the briefing .
46 The domestic
agencies ' limited response indicates that they did not perceive a call to action .
Clarke reflected a different perspective in an email to Rice on September 15, 2001 .
He summarized the steps taken by the CSG to alert domestic agencies to the
possibility of an attack in the United States .
Clarke concluded that domestic
agencies , including the FAA , knew that the CSG believed a major al Qaeda attack was
coming and could be in the United States .
Although the FAA had authority to issue security directives mandating new security
procedures , none of the few that were released during the summer of 2001 increased
security at checkpoints or on board aircraft .
The information circulars mostly urged
air carriers to `` exercise prudence '' and be alert .
Prior to 9/11 , the FAA did present
a CD-ROM to air carriers and airport authorities describing the increased threat to
civil aviation .
The presentation mentioned the possibility of suicide hijackings but
said that `` fortunately , we have no indication that any group is currently thinking
in that direction . ''
The FAA conducted 27 special security
briefings for specific air carriers between May 1, 2001 , and September 11, 2001 .
Two
of these briefings discussed the hijacking threat overseas .
None discussed the
possibility of suicide hijackings or the use of aircraft as weapons .
No new security
measures were instituted .
Rice told us she understood that the FBI had tasked its 56 U.S. field offices to
increase surveillance of suspected terrorists and to reach out to informants who
might have information about terrorist plots .
An NSC staff document at the time
describes such a tasking as having occurred in late June but does not indicate
whether it was generated by the NSC or the FBI .
Other than the previously described
April 13 communication sent to all FBI field offices , however , the FBI could not
find any record of having received such a directive .
The April 13 document asking
field offices to gather information on Sunni extremism did not mention any possible
threat within the United States and did not order surveillance of suspected
operatives .
The NSC did not specify what the FBI 's directives should contain and did
not review what had been issued earlier .
Acting FBI Director Pickard told us that in addition to his July 19 conference call,
he mentioned the heightened terrorist threat in individual calls with the special
agents in charge of field offices during their annual performance review
discussions .
In speaking with agents around the country , we found little evidence
that any such concerns had reached FBI personnel beyond the New York Field
Office .
The head of counterterrorism at the FBI , Dale Watson , said he had many discussions
about possible attacks with Cofer Black at the CIA .
They had expected an attack on
July 4 .
Watson said he felt deeply that something was going to happen .
But he told
us the threat information was `` nebulous . ''
He wished he had known more .
He wished he
had had `` 500 analysts looking at Usama Bin Ladin threat information instead of
two . ''
Attorney General Ashcroft was briefed by the CIA in May and by Pickard in early July
about the danger .
Pickard said he met with Ashcroft once a week in late June ,
through July , and twice in August .
There is a dispute regarding Ashcroft 's interest
in Pickard 's briefings about the terrorist threat situation .
Pickard told us that
after two such briefings Ashcroft told him that he did not want to hear about the
threats anymore .
Ashcroft denies Pickard 's charge .
Pickard says he continued to
present terrorism information during further briefings that summer , but nothing
further on the `` chatter '' the U.S. government was receiving .
The Attorney General told us he asked Pickard whether there was intelligence about
attacks in the United States and that Pickard said no . Pickard said he replied that
he could not assure Ashcroft that there would be no attacks in the United States ,
although the reports of threats were related to overseas targets .
Ashcroft said he
therefore assumed the FBI was doing what it needed to do .
He acknowledged that in
retrospect , this was a dangerous assumption .
He did not ask the FBI what it was
doing in response to the threats and did not task it to take any specific action .
He
also did not direct the INS , then still part of the Department of Justice , to take
any specific action .
In sum , the domestic agencies never mobilized in response to the threat .
They did not
have direction , and did not have a plan to institute .
The borders were not hardened .
Transportation systems were not fortified .
Electronic surveillance was not targeted
against a domestic threat .
State and local law enforcement were not marshaled to augment the FBI 's efforts .
The
public was not warned .
The terrorists exploited deep institutional failings within our government .
The
question is whether extra vigilance might have turned up an opportunity to disrupt
the plot .
As seen in chapter 7 , al Qaeda's operatives made mistakes .
At least two
such mistakes created opportunities during 2001 , especially in late August .
LATE LEADS-MIHDHAR , MOUSSAOUI , AND KSM
In chapter 6 we discussed how intelligence agencies successfully detected some of the
early travel in the planes operation , picking up the movements of Khalid al Mihdhar
and identifying him , and seeing his travel converge with someone they perhaps could
have identified but did not- Nawaf al Hazmi -as well as with less easily identifiable
people such as Khallad and Abu Bara .
These observations occurred in December 1999
and January 2000 .
The trail had been lost in January 2000 without a clear
realization that it had been lost , and without much effort to pick it up again .
Nor
had the CIA placed Mihdhar on the State Department 's watchlist for suspected
terrorists , so that either an embassy or a port of entry might take note if Mihdhar
showed up again .
On four occasions in 2001 , the CIA , the FBI , or both had apparent opportunities to
refocus on the significance of Hazmi and Mihdhar and reinvigorate the search for
them .
After reviewing those episodes we will turn to the handling of the Moussaoui
case and some late leads regarding Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
January 2001 : Identification of Khallad
Almost one year after the original trail had been lost in Bangkok , the FBI and the
CIA were working on the investigation of the Cole bombing .
They learned of the link
between a captured conspirator and a person called `` Khallad . ''
They also learned that
Khallad was a senior security official for Bin Ladin who had helped direct the
bombing ( we introduced Khallad in chapter 5 , and returned to his role in the Cole
bombing in chapter 6 ) .55 One of the members of the FBI 's investigative team in Yemen
realized that he had heard of Khallad before , from a joint FBI / CIA source four
months earlier .
The FBI agent obtained from a foreign government a photo of the
person believed to have directed the Cole bombing .
It was shown to the source , and
he confirmed that the man in that photograph was the same Khallad he had
described .
In December 2000 , on the basis of some links associated with Khalid al Mihdhar , the
CIA 's Bin Ladin unit speculated that Khallad and Khalid al Mihdhar might be one and
the same .
The CIA asked that a Kuala Lumpur surveillance photo of Mihdhar be shown to the joint
source who had identified Khallad .
In early January 2001 , two photographs from the
Kuala Lumpur meeting were shown to the source .
One was a known photograph of
Mihdhar , the other a photograph of a then unknown subject .
The source did not
recognize Mihdhar .
But he indicated he was 90 percent certain that the other
individual was Khallad .
This meant that Khallad and Mihdhar were two different people .
It also meant that
there was a link between Khallad and Mihdhar , making Mihdhar seem even more
suspicious.59Yet we found no effort by the CIA to renew the long-abandoned search
for Mihdhar or his travel companions .
In addition , we found that the CIA did not notify the FBI of this identification .
DCITenet and Cofer Black testified before Congress 's Joint Inquiry into 9/11 that
the FBI had access to this identification from the beginning .
But drawing on an
extensive record , including documents that were not available to the CIA personnel
who drafted that testimony , we conclude this was not the case .
The FBI 's primary
Cole investigators had no knowledge that Khallad had been in Kuala Lumpur with
Mihdhar and others until after the September 11 attacks .
Because the FBI had not
been informed in January 2000 about Mihdhar 's possession of a U.S. visa , it had not
then started looking for him in the United States .
Because it did not know of the
links between Khallad and Mihdhar , it did not start looking for him in January
2001 .
This incident is an example of how day-to-day gaps in information sharing can emerge
even when there is mutual goodwill .
The information was from a joint FBI / CIA source
who spoke essentially no English and whose languages were not understood by the FBI
agent on the scene overseas .
Issues of travel and security necessarily kept short
the amount of time spent with the source .
As a result , the CIA officer usually did
not translate either questions or answers for his FBI colleague and friend .
For interviews without simultaneous translation , the FBI agent on the scene received
copies of the reports that the CIA disseminated to other agencies regarding the
interviews .
But he was not given access to the CIA 's internal operational reports,
which contained more detail .
It was there-in reporting to which FBI investigators
did not have access-that information regarding the January 2001 identification of
Khallad appeared .
The CIA officer does not recall this particular identification and
thus can not say why it was not shared with his FBI colleague .
He might not have
understood the possible significance of the new identification .
In June 2000 , Mihdhar left California and returned to Yemen .
It is possible that if,
in January 2001 , the CIA had resumed its search for him , placed him on the State
Department's TIPOFF watchlist , or provided the FBI with the information , he might
have been found-either before or at the time he applied for a new visa in June 2001 ,
or when he returned to the United States on July 4 .
Spring 2001 : Looking Again at Kuala Lumpur
By mid- May 2001 , as the threat reports were surging , a CIA official detailed to the
International Terrorism Operations Section at the FBI wondered where the attacks
might occur .
We will call him `` John . ''
Recalling the episode about the Kuala Lumpur
travel of Mihdhar and his associates , `` John '' searched the CIA 's databases for
information regarding the travel .
On May 15 , he and an official at the CIA
reexamined many of the old cables from early 2000 , including the information that
Mihdhar had a U.S. visa , and that Hazmi had come to Los Angeles on January 15 ,
2000 .
The CIA official who reviewed the cables took no action regarding them .
'' John , ''
however , began a lengthy exchange with a CIA analyst , whom we will call `` Dave , '' to
figure out what these cables meant .
'' John '' was aware of how dangerous Khallad was-at
one point calling him a `` major league killer . ''
He concluded that `` something bad was
definitely up . ''
Despite the U.S. links evident in this traffic , '' John '' made no effort
to determine whether any of these individuals was in the United States .
He did not
raise that possibility with his FBI counterpart .
He was focused on Malaysia .
'' John" described the CIA as an agency that tended to play a `` zone defense . ''
He was
worrying solely about Southeast Asia , not the United States .
In contrast , he told
us , the FBI tends to play `` man-to-man . ''
Desk officers at the CIA 's Bin Ladin unit did not have `` cases '' in the same sense as
an FBI agent who works an investigation from beginning to end .
Thus , when the trail
went cold after the Kuala Lumpur meeting in January 2000 , the desk officer moved on
to different things .
By the time the March 2000 cable arrived with information that
one of the travelers had flown to Los Angeles , the case officer was no longer
responsible for follow-up .
While several individuals at the Bin Ladin unit opened
the cable when it arrived in March 2000 , no action was taken .
The CIA 's zone defense concentrated on `` where , '' not `` who . ''
Had its information been
shared with the FBI , a combination of the CIA 's zone defense and the FBI 's
man-to-man approach might have been productive .
June 2001 : The Meeting in New York
'' John 's '' review of the Kuala Lumpur meeting did set off some more sharing of
information , getting the attention of an FBI analyst whom we will call `` Jane . ''
'' Jane '' was assigned to the FBI 's Cole investigation .
She knew that another terrorist
involved in that operation , Fahd al Quso , had traveled to Bangkok in January 2000 to
give money to Khallad .
'' Jane '' and the CIA analyst , '' Dave , '' had been working together on Colerelated issues .
Chasing Quso 's trail , `` Dave '' suggested showing some photographs to FBI agents in New
York who were working on the Cole case and had interviewed Quso .
'' John '' gave three Kuala Lumpur surveillance pictures to `` Jane '' to show to the New
York agents .
She was told that one of the individuals in the photographs was someone
named Khalid al Mihdhar .
She did not know why the photographs had been taken or why
the Kuala Lumpur travel might be significant , and she was not told that someone had
identified Khallad in the photographs .
When `` Jane '' did some research in a database
for intelligence reports , Intelink , she found the original NSA reports on the
planning for the meeting .
Because the CIA had not disseminated reports on its
tracking of Mihdhar , `` Jane '' did not pull up any information about Mihdhar 's U.S. visa
or about travel to the United States by Hazmi or Mihdhar .
'' Jane , '' '' Dave , '' and an FBI analyst who was on detail to the CIA 's Bin Ladin unit went
to New York on June 11 to meet with the agents about the Cole case .
'' Jane '' brought
the surveillance pictures .
At some point in the meeting she showed the photographs
to the agents and asked whether they recognized Quso in any of them .
The agents
asked questions about the photographs- Why were they taken ?
Why were these people
being followed ?
Where are the rest of the photographs ?
The only information `` Jane '' had about the meeting-other than the photographs-were the
NSA reports that she had found on Intelink .
These reports , however , contained
caveats that their contents could not be shared with criminal investigators without
the permission of the Justice Department 's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review
( OIPR ) .
Therefore `` Jane '' concluded that she could not pass on information from those
reports to the agents .
This decision was potentially significant , because the
signals intelligence she did not share linked Mihdhar to a suspected terrorist
facility in the Middle East .
The agents would have established a link to the
suspected facility from their work on the embassy bombings case .
This link would
have made them very interested in learning more about Mihdhar .
The sad irony is that the agents who found the source were being kept from obtaining
the fruits of their own work .
'' Dave , '' the CIA analyst , knew more about the Kuala
Lumpur meeting .
He knew that Mihdhar possessed a U.S. visa , that his visa
application indicated that he intended to travel to New York , that Hazmi had
traveled to Los Angeles , and that a source had put Mihdhar in the company of
Khallad .
No one at the meeting asked him what he knew ; he did not volunteer
anything .
He told investigators that as a CIA analyst , he was not authorized to
answer FBI questions regarding CIA information . ''
Jane '' said she assumed that if
'' Dave '' knew the answers to questions , he would have volunteered them .
The New York
agents left the meeting without obtaining information that might have started them
looking for Mihdhar .
Mihdhar had been a weak link in al Qaeda 's operational planning .
He had left the
United States in June 2000 , a mistake KSM realized could endanger the entire
plan-for to continue with the operation , Mihdhar would have to travel to the United
States again .
And unlike other operatives , Mihdhar was not `` clean '' : he had jihadist
connections .
It was just such connections that had brought him to the attention of
U.S. officials .
Nevertheless , in this case KSM 's fears were not realized .
Mihdhar received a new U.S.
visa two days after the CIA - FBI meeting in New York .
He flew to New York City on
July 4 .
No one was looking for him .
August 2001 : The Search for Mihdhar and Hazmi Begins and Fails
During the summer of 2001 `` John , '' following a good instinct but not as part of any
formal assignment , asked `` Mary , '' an FBI analyst detailed to the CIA 's Bin Ladin
unit , to review all the Kuala Lumpur materials one more time .
She had been at the
New York meeting with `` Jane '' and `` Dave '' but had not looked into the issues yet
herself . ''
John '' asked her to do the research in her free time .
'' Mary '' began her work on July 24 .
That day , she found the cable reporting that
Mihdhar had a visa to the United States .
A week later , she found the cable reporting
that Mihdhar 's visa application-what was later discovered to be his first
application-listed New York as his destination .
On August 21 , she located the March
2000 cable that `` noted with interest '' that Hazmi had flown to Los Angeles in January
2000 .
She immediately grasped the significance of this information .
'' Mary '' and `` Jane '' promptly met with an INS representative at FBI headquarters .
On
August 22 , the INS told them that Mihdhar had entered the United States on January
15, 2000 , and again on July 4, 2001 .
'' Jane '' and `` Mary '' also learned that there was
no record that Hazmi had left the country since January 2000 , and they assumed he
had left with Mihdhar in June 2000 .
They decided that if Mihdhar was in the United
States , he should be found .
They divided up the work . ''
Mary '' asked the Bin Ladin unit to draft a cable requesting
that Mihdhar and Hazmi be put on the TIPOFF watchlist .
Both Hazmi and Mihdhar were
added to this watchlist on August 24 .
'' Jane '' took responsibility for the search effort inside the United States .
As the
information indicated that Mihdhar had last arrived in New York , she began drafting
what is known as a lead for the FBI 's New York Field Office .
A lead relays
information from one part of the FBI to another and requests that a particular
action be taken .
She called an agent in New York to give him a `` headsup '' on the
matter , but her draft lead was not sent until August 28 .
Her email told the New York
agent that she wanted him to get started as soon as possible , but she labeled the
lead as `` Routine '' -a designation that informs the receiving office that it has 30
days to respond .
The agent who received the lead forwarded it to his squad supervisor .
That same day,
the supervisor forwarded the lead to an intelligence agent to open an intelligence
case-an agent who thus was behind `` the wall '' keeping FBI intelligence information
from being shared with criminal prosecutors .
He also sent it to the Cole case agents
and an agent who had spent significant time in Malaysia searching for another
Khalid : Khalid Sheikh Mohammad .
The suggested goal of the investigation was to locate Mihdhar , determine his contacts
and reasons for being in the United States , and possibly conduct an interview .
Before sending the lead , `` Jane '' had discussed it with `` John , '' the CIA official on
detail to the FBI .
She had also checked with the acting head of the FBI 's Bin Ladin
unit .
The discussion seems to have been limited to whether the search should be
classified as an intelligence investigation or as a criminal one .
It appears that no
one informed higher levels of management in either the FBI or CIA about the
case .
There is no evidence that the lead , or the search for these terrorist suspects , was
substantively discussed at any level above deputy chief of a section within the
Counterterrorism Division at FBI headquarters .
One of the Cole case agents read the lead with interest , and contacted `` Jane '' to
obtain more information . ''
Jane '' argued , however , that because the agent was
designated a `` criminal ''
FBI agent , not an intelligence FBI agent , the wall kept him
from participating in any search for Mihdhar .
In fact , she felt he had to destroy
his copy of the lead because it contained NSA information from reports that included
caveats ordering that the information not be shared without OIPR 's permission .
The
agent asked `` Jane '' to get an opinion from the FBI 's National Security Law Unit
( NSLU ) on whether he could open a criminal case on Mihdhar .
'' Jane '' sent an email to the Cole case agent explaining that according to the NSLU ,
the case could be opened only as an intelligence matter , and that if Mihdhar was
found , only designated intelligence agents could conduct or even be present at any
interview .
She appears to have misunderstood the complex rules that could apply to
this situation .
The FBI agent angrily responded:
Whatever has happened to this-someday someone will die-and wall or not-the
public will not understand why we were not more effective and throwing every
resource we had at certain `` problems . ''
Let 's hope the National Security Law Unit
will stand behind their decisions then , especially since the biggest threat to
us now , UBL , is getting the most `` protection . ''
'' Jane" replied that she was not making up the rules ; she claimed that they were in
the relevant manual and `` ordered by the [ FISA ] Court and every office of the FBI is
required to follow them including FBI NY . ''
It is now clear that everyone involved was confused about the rules governing the
sharing and use of information gathered in intelligence channels .
Because Mihdhar
was being sought for his possible connection to or knowledge of the Cole bombing , he
could be investigated or tracked under the existing Cole criminal case .
No new
criminal case was needed for the criminal agent to begin searching for Mihdhar .
And
as NSA had approved the passage of its information to the criminal agent , he could
have conducted a search using all available information .
As a result of this
confusion , the criminal agents who were knowledgeable about al Qaeda and experienced
with criminal investigative techniques , including finding suspects and possible
criminal charges , were thus excluded from the search .
The search was assigned to one FBI agent , and it was his very first counterterrorism
lead .
Because the lead was `` routine , '' he was given 30 days to open an intelligence
case and make some unspecified efforts to locate Mihdhar .
He started the process a
few days later .
He checked local New York databases for criminal record and driver 's
license information and checked the hotel listed on Mihdhar 's U.S. entry form .
Finally , on September 11 , the agent sent a lead to Los Angeles , because Mihdhar had
initially arrived in Los Angeles in January 2000 .
We believe that if more resources had been applied and a significantly different
approach taken , Mihdhar and Hazmi might have been found .
They had used their true
names in the United States .
Still , the investigators would have needed luck as well
as skill to find them prior to September 11 even if such searches had begun as early
as August 23 , when the lead was first drafted .
Many FBI witnesses have suggested that even if Mihdhar had been found , there was
nothing the agents could have done except follow him onto the planes .
We believe
this is incorrect .
Both Hazmi and Mihdhar could have been held for immigration
violations or as material witnesses in the Cole bombing case .
Investigation or
interrogation of them , and investigation of their travel and financial activities,
could have yielded evidence of connections to other participants in the 9/11 plot .
The simple fact of their detention could have derailed the plan .
In any case , the
opportunity did not arise .
Phoenix Memo
The Phoenix memo was investigated thoroughly by the Joint Inquiry and the Department
of Justice Inspector General.86We will recap it briefly here .
In July 2001 , an FBI
agent in the Phoenix field office sent a memo to FBI headquarters and to two agents
on international terrorism squads in the New York Field Office , advising of the
'' possibility of a coordinated effort by Usama Bin Ladin '' to send students to the
United States to attend civil aviation schools .
The agent based his theory on the
'' inordinate number of individuals of investigative interest '' attending such schools
in Arizona .
The agent made four recommendations to FBI headquarters : to compile a list of civil
aviation schools , establish liaison with those schools , discuss his theories about
Bin Ladin with the intelligence community , and seek authority to obtain visa
information on persons applying to flight schools .
His recommendations were not
acted on .
His memo was forwarded to one field office .
Managers of the Usama Bin
Ladin unit and the Radical Fundamentalist unit at FBI headquarters were addressees,
but they did not even see the memo until after September 11 .
No managers at
headquarters saw the memo before September 11 , and the New York Field Office took no
action .
As its author told investigators , the Phoenix memo was not an alert about suicide
pilots .
His worry was more about a Pan Am Flight 103 scenario in which explosives
were placed on an aircraft .
The memo 's references to aviation training were broad,
including aeronautical engineering .
If the memo had been distributed in a timely fashion and its recommendations acted on
promptly , we do not believe it would have uncovered the plot .
It might well,
however , have sensitized the FBI so that it might have taken the Moussaoui matter
more seriously the next month .
Zacarias Moussaoui
On August 15, 2001 , the Minneapolis FBI Field Office initiated an intelligence
investigation on Zacarias Moussaoui .
As mentioned in chapter 7 , he had entered the
United States in February 2001 , and had begun flight lessons at Airman Flight School
in Norman , Oklahoma .
He resumed his training at the Pan Am International Flight
Academy in Eagan , Minnesota , starting on August 13 .
He had none of the usual
qualifications for flight training on Pan Am 's Boeing 747 flight simulators .
He said
he did not intend to become a commercial pilot but wanted the training as an `` ego
boosting thing . ''
Moussaoui stood out because , with little knowledge of flying , he
wanted to learn how to `` take off and land '' a Boeing 747 .
The agent in Minneapolis quickly learned that Moussaoui possessed jihadist beliefs .
Moreover , Moussaoui had $32,000 in a bank account but did not provide a plausible
explanation for this sum of money .
He had traveled to Pakistan but became agitated
when asked if he had traveled to nearby countries while in Pakistan ( Pakistan was
the customary route to the training camps in Afghanistan ) .
He planned to receive
martial arts training , and intended to purchase a global positioning receiver .
The
agent also noted that Moussaoui became extremely agitated whenever he was questioned
regarding his religious beliefs .
The agent concluded that Moussaoui was `` an Islamic
extremist preparing for some future act in furtherance of radical fundamentalist
goals . ''
He also believed Moussaoui 's plan was related to his flight training .
Moussaoui can be seen as an al Qaeda mistake and a missed opportunity .
An apparently
unreliable operative , he had fallen into the hands of the FBI .
As discussed in
chapter 7 , Moussaoui had been in contact with and received money from Ramzi
Binalshibh .
If Moussaoui had been connected to al Qaeda , questions should instantly
have arisen about a possible al Qaeda plot that involved piloting airliners , a
possibility that had never been seriously analyzed by the intelligence community .
The FBI agent who handled the case in conjunction with the INS representative on the
Minneapolis Joint Terrorism Task Force suspected that Moussaoui might be planning to
hijack a plane .
Minneapolis and FBI headquarters debated whether Moussaoui should be
arrested immediately or surveilled to obtain additional information .
Because it was
not clear whether Moussaoui could be imprisoned , the FBI case agent decided the most
important thing was to prevent Moussaoui from obtaining any further training that he
could use to carry out a potential attack .
As a French national who had overstayed his visa , Moussaoui could be detained
immediately .
The INS arrested Moussaoui on the immigration violation .
A deportation
order was signed on August 17, 2001 .
The agents in Minnesota were concerned that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Minneapolis
would find insufficient probable cause of a crime to obtain a criminal warrant to
search Moussaoui 's laptop computer .
Agents at FBI headquarters believed there was insufficient probable cause .
Minneapolis therefore sought a special warrant under the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act to conduct the search ( we introduced FISA in chapter 3 ) .
To do so , however , the FBI needed to demonstrate probable cause that Moussaoui was an
agent of a foreign power , a demonstration that was not required to obtain a criminal
warrant but was a statutory requirement for a FISA warrant .
The case agent did not have sufficient information to connect Moussaoui to a `` foreign
power , '' so he reached out for help , in the United States and overseas .
The FBI agent 's August 18 message requested assistance from the FBI legal attach� in
Paris .
Moussaoui had lived in London , so the Minneapolis agent sought assistance
from the legal attach� there as well .
By August 24 , the Minneapolis agent had also
contacted an FBI detailee and a CIA desk officer at the Counterterrorist Center
about the case .
The FBI legal attach� 's office in Paris first contacted the French government on
August 16 or 17 , shortly after speaking to the Minneapolis case agent on the
telephone .
On August 22 and 27 , the French provided information that made a
connection between Moussaoui and a rebel leader in Chechnya , Ibn al Khattab .
This
set off a spirited debate between the Minneapolis Field Office , FBI headquarters,
and the CIA as to whether the Chechen rebels and Khattab were sufficiently
associated with a terrorist organization to constitute a `` foreign power '' for
purposes of the FISA statute .
FBI headquarters did not believe this was good enough,
and its National Security Law Unit declined to submit a FISA application .
After receiving the written request for assistance , the legal attach� in London had
promptly forwarded it to his counterparts in the British government , hand-delivering
the request on August 21 .
On August 24 , the CIA also sent a cable to London and
Paris regarding `` subjects involved in suspicious 747 flight training '' that described
Moussaoui as a possible `` suicide hijacker . ''
On August 28 , the CIA sent a request for
information to a different service of the British government ; this communication
warned that Moussaoui might be expelled to Britain by the end of August .
The FBI
office in London raised the matter briefly with British officials as an aside , after
a meeting about a more urgent matter on September 3 , and sent the British service a
written update on September 5 .
The case was not handled by the British as a priority
amid a large number of other terrorist-related inquiries .
On September 4 , the FBI sent a teletype to the CIA , the FAA , the Customs Service , the
State Department , the INS , and the Secret Service summarizing the known facts
regarding Moussaoui .
It did not report the case agent 's personal assessment that
Moussaoui planned to hijack an airplane .
It did contain the FAA 's comment that it
was not unusual for Middle Easterners to attend flight training schools in the
United States .
Although the Minneapolis agents wanted to tell the FAA from the beginning about
Moussaoui , FBI headquarters instructed Minneapolis that it could not share the more
complete report the case agent had prepared for the FAA .
The Minneapolis supervisor
sent the case agent in person to the local FAA office to fill in what he thought
were gaps in the FBI headquarters teletype .
No FAA actions seem to have been taken in response .
There was substantial disagreement between Minneapolis agents and FBI headquarters as
to what Moussaoui was planning to do .
In one conversation between a Minneapolis
supervisor and a headquarters agent , the latter complained that Minneapolis 's FISA
request was couched in a manner intended to get people `` spun up . ''
The supervisor
replied that was precisely his intent .
He said he was `` trying to keep someone from
taking a plane and crashing into the World Trade Center . ''
The headquarters agent
replied that this was not going to happen and that they did not know if Moussaoui
was a terrorist .
There is no evidence that either FBI Acting Director Pickard or Assistant Director
for Counterterrorism Dale Watson was briefed on the Moussaoui case prior to 9/11 .
Michael Rolince , the FBI assistant director heading the Bureau 's
InternationalTerrorism Operations Section ( ITOS ) , recalled being told about
Moussaoui in two passing hallway conversations but only in the context that he might
be receiving telephone calls from Minneapolis complaining about how headquarters was
handling the matter .
He never received such a call .
Although the acting special
agent in charge of Minneapolis called the ITOS supervisors to discuss the Moussaoui
case on August 27 , he declined to go up the chain of command at FBI headquarters and
call Rolince .
On August 23 , DCI Tenet was briefed about the Moussaoui case in a briefing titled
'' Islamic Extremist Learns to Fly . ''
Tenet was also told
that Moussaoui wanted to learn to fly a 747 , paid for his training in cash , was
interested to learn the doors do not open in flight , and wanted to fly a simulated
flight from London to New York .
He was told that the FBI had arrested Moussaoui
because of a visa overstay and that the CIA was working the case with the FBI .
Tenet
told us that no connection to al Qaeda was apparent to him at the time .
Seeing it as
an FBI case , he did not discuss the matter with anyone at the White House or the
FBI .
No connection was made between Moussaoui 's presence in the United States and
the threat reporting during the summer of 2001 .
On September 11 , after the attacks , the FBI office in London renewed their appeal for
information about Moussaoui .
In response to U.S. requests , the British government
supplied some basic biographical information about Moussaoui .
The British government
informed us that it also immediately tasked intelligence collection facilities for
information about Moussaoui .
On September 13 , the British government received new,
sensitive intelligence that Moussaoui had attended an al Qaeda training camp in
Afghanistan .
It passed this intelligence to the United States on the same day .
Had
this information been available in late August 2001 , the Moussaoui case would almost
certainly have received intense , high-level attention .
The FBI also learned after 9/11 that the millennium terrorist Ressam , who by 2001 was
cooperating with investigators , recognized Moussaoui as someone who had been in the
Afghan camps .
As mentioned above , before 9/11 the FBI agents in Minneapolis had failed to persuade
supervisors at headquarters that there was enough evidence to seek a FISA warrant to
search Moussaoui 's computer hard drive and belongings .
Either the British
information or the Ressam identification would have broken the logjam .
A maximum U.S. effort to investigate Moussaoui conceivably could have unearthed his
connections to Binalshibh .
Those connections might have brought investigators to the
core of the 9/11 plot .
The Binalshibh connection was recognized shortly after 9/11,
though it was not an easy trail to find .
Discovering it would have required quick
and very substantial cooperation from the German government , which might well have
been difficult to obtain .
However , publicity about Moussaoui 's arrest and a possible
hijacking threat might have derailed the plot.107With time , the search for Mihdhar
and Hazmi and the investigation of Moussaoui might also have led to a breakthrough
that would have disrupted the plot .
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed
Another late opportunity was presented by a confluence of information regarding
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed received by the intelligence community in the summer of 2001 .
The possible links between KSM , Moussaoui , and an individual only later identified
as Ramzi Binalshibh would remain undiscovered , however .
Although we readily equate KSM with al Qaeda today , this was not the case before
9/11 .
KSM , who had been indicted in January 1996 for his role in the Manila air
plot , was seen primarily as another freelance terrorist , associated with Ramzi
Yousef .
Because the links between KSM and Bin Ladin or al Qaeda were not recognized
at the time , responsibility for KSM remained in the small Islamic Extremist Branch
of the Counterterrorist Center , not in the Bin Ladin unit .
Moreover , because KSM had already been indicted , he became targeted for arrest .
In
1997 , the Counterterrorist Center added a Renditions Branch to help find wanted
fugitives .
Responsibility for KSM was transferred to this branch , which gave the CIA
a `` man-to-man '' focus but was not an analytical unit .
When subsequent information
came , more critical for analysis than for tracking , no unit had the job of following
up on what the information might mean .
For example , in September 2000 , a source had reported that an individual named Khalid
al-Shaykh al-Ballushi was a key lieutenant in al Qaeda .
Al- Ballushi means `` from
Baluchistan , '' and KSM is from Baluchistan .
Recognizing the possible significance of
this information , the Bin Ladin unit sought more information .
When no information
was forthcoming , the Bin Ladin unit dropped the matter .
When additional pieces of the puzzle arrived in the spring and summer of 2001 , they
were not put together .
The first piece of the puzzle concerned some intriguing information associated with a
person known as `` Mukhtar '' that the CIA had begun analyzing in April 2001 .
The CIA
did not know who Mukhtar was at the time-only that he associated with al Qaeda
lieutenant Abu Zubaydah and that , based on the nature of the information , he was
evidently involved in planning possible terrorist activities .
The second piece of the puzzle was some alarming information regarding KSM .
On June
12, 2001 , a CIA report said that `` Khaled '' was actively recruiting people to travel
outside Afghanistan , including to the United States where colleagues were reportedly
already in the country to meet them , to carry out terrorist-related activities for
Bin Ladin .
CIA headquarters presumed from the details of the reporting that this
person was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
In July , the same source was shown a series of
photographs and identified a photograph of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as the Khaled he
had previously discussed .
The final piece of the puzzle arrived at the CIA 's Bin Ladin unit on August 28 in a
cable reporting that KSM 's nickname was Mukhtar .
No one made the connection to the
reports about Mukhtar that had been circulated in the spring .
This connection might
also have underscored concern about the June reporting that KSM was recruiting
terrorists to travel , including to the United States .
Only after 9/11 would it be
discovered that Muhktar/KSM had communicated with a phone that was used by
Binalshibh , and that Binalshibh had used the same phone to communicate with
Moussaoui , as discussed in chapter 7 .
As in the Moussaoui situation already
described , the links to Binalshibh might not have been an easy trail to find and
would have required substantial cooperation from the German government .
But time was
short , and running out .
Time Runs Out
As Tenet told us , `` the system was blinking red '' during the summer of 2001 .
Officials
were alerted across the world .
Many were doing everything they possibly could to
respond to the threats .
Yet no one working on these late leads in the summer of 2001 connected the case in
his or her in-box to the threat reports agitating senior officials and being briefed
to the President .
Thus , these individual cases did not become national priorities .
As the CIA supervisor `` John" told us , no one looked at the bigger picture ; no
analytic work foresaw the lightning that could connect the thundercloud to the
ground .
We see little evidence that the progress of the plot was disturbed by any government
action .
The U.S. government was unable to capitalize on mistakes made by al Qaeda .
Time ran out .
